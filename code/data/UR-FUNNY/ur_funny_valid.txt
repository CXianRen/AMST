4421, FUNNY, ### and some in washington have a lot more of it
14436, NOTFUNNY, ### and the gems are always the outermost aspects of our personality
15452, NOTFUNNY, ### i love working
9150, NOTFUNNY, ### it's going to the east and you'd like to go north
3424, FUNNY, ### and when the rich players talked about why they had inevitably won in this rigged game of monopoly
2032, NOTFUNNY, ### it was just at the end of a regular day of work with the foundation
4420, FUNNY, ### and he had a random mutation that gave him six fingers on each hand which turns out to be really useful if you're a pitcher
12706, NOTFUNNY, ### i decided to research the science and the habits of the place and i started with the genetic profile
12784, FUNNY, ### when that doesn't work when it turns out those people have all the same facts that we do and they still disagree with us then we move on to a second assumption which is that they're idiots
8883, NOTFUNNY, ### but to really see the details of the bee and really appreciate what it is you have to look a little bit closer
7661, FUNNY, ### she had forgotten to make that clear earlier because she assumed it was
15577, NOTFUNNY, ### potable water arable land rainforests oil gas they're going away and they're going away soon and unless we innovate our way out of this mess we're going away too
5059, NOTFUNNY, ### but they mean two different things
15181, NOTFUNNY, ### we were rushed to the center of town and there on a tarmac we were split into two lines
14138, FUNNY, ### but i'm not here from the chamber of commerce
8404, NOTFUNNY, ### remember i was young then
8816, NOTFUNNY, ### close the divide by engaging in communication and relationships that matter
2264, FUNNY, ### wanted to be when you were do you know what i wanted to be i wanted to be a biker chick
2784, NOTFUNNY, ### in i had a series of losses
8993, FUNNY, ### this one is called on donating my brain to science
10609, FUNNY, ### so i couldn't figure out for the life of me why we were supposed to be so rowdy or why we had to spell this word incorrectly
7035, NOTFUNNY, ### we forgot responsibility
1186, FUNNY, ### but i just think of so many occurrences like the time he went on the oprah show and asked her what the show would be about
4405, FUNNY, ### and like a good millennial i documented it on social media
2881, FUNNY, ### this is a bird god tied up to a battleship
14480, FUNNY, ### and by now some of you may be asking yourselves and i just want to reassure you that i did get half the money up front
10666, FUNNY, ### until you forget
14109, FUNNY, ### next we can actually light them up with a laser
439, NOTFUNNY, ### this is like a little payback or something for million people calling me the loser
13936, FUNNY, ### she paused and said i don't know if that's yuan or american dollars but anyway it's
13557, NOTFUNNY, ### i like to so i know where it is
7377, NOTFUNNY, ### two million years ago humans evolved in africa and then slowly but surely spread out across the entire planet by reaching into the wilderness that was beyond their horizons
14376, FUNNY, ### i took it back to the pentagon after it got declassified when the patent issued and told the people back there about it and they laughed and then i took them back a demo and they bought
948, FUNNY, ### and then they hopped in it turned the little electronic key rather than the real key zipped home on their new superhighway and drove straight into a garage that looks like a tudor castle
6570, FUNNY, ### a squirrel is chewing on your internet
1281, NOTFUNNY, ### and then changing levels
7179, FUNNY, ### he said what scientists do when a paradigm fails is guess what they carry on as if nothing had happened
3219, FUNNY, ### i know these are tough and you may have a hard time getting your hand bent around it but this is actually critical
859, FUNNY, ### i never practiced law a day in my life i pretty much wasn't allowed to
12920, FUNNY, ### that splendid music the coming in music the elephant march from aida is the music i've chosen for my funeral
10017, NOTFUNNY, ### she said life's too short i just can't keep going with this
12113, FUNNY, ### and in the end don't tell siri this we can always unplug them
5289, NOTFUNNY, ### this is one my partner and i worked on
7072, FUNNY, ### if they liked an aria they would holler and suggest that it be done again as an encore not at the end of the show but immediately
7717, NOTFUNNY, ### here's what he wrote in starting that out
1217, FUNNY, ### at that point they usually give up
12593, NOTFUNNY, ### so in short yeah the are coming for our jobs
12600, FUNNY, ### and there will be about a percent chance we'll recover him
4360, FUNNY, ### when they say to you what do you do you say i'm a statistician
13167, FUNNY, ### whereas some of you might have thought black would have been so much more slimming
4183, NOTFUNNY, ### never are we so present as when we are in the midst of the great past
3293, FUNNY, ### now hand your unlocked phone to the person on your left
10953, FUNNY, ### so the first thing that they tell you is that you need to have a certificate of burial before you can go ahead you're not allowed to just murder people and put them under the patio
8075, FUNNY, ### so we really haven't progressed that much since
13790, FUNNY, ### and these buttons there those are chicken eggs
10391, NOTFUNNY, ### and the chair in the background is my favorite chair
6245, NOTFUNNY, ### i ended up with blunt chest trauma
11528, FUNNY, ### so some of the stuff is a little dense
13710, NOTFUNNY, ### i say now listen
370, FUNNY, ### he obviously spends a lot of time on that hair
8598, NOTFUNNY, ### but if our politicians can't agree on things like health care or even school lunches i just don't see a path where they'll find consensus on something as big and as expensive as universal basic life income
1478, NOTFUNNY, ### it primes you to do things that strengthen close relationships
4812, FUNNY, ### my english lost i wanted to vomit
9472, NOTFUNNY, ### and the same holds true for a concept in
7345, NOTFUNNY, ### and then something weird happens
8731, FUNNY, ### that one over there for example has aspirations to become a flying on broadway
2963, FUNNY, ### he hides his sensitivities and romantic side because in russia among guys that's not cool to be romantic but it's cool to be surrounded with women and look like an aggressive hulk
9736, NOTFUNNY, ### and you'd think he was chasing finches but he wasn't
6667, NOTFUNNY, ### but i can't help
6854, FUNNY, ### and testing to simulate a person in a wetsuit in the water with a predatory shark in a natural environment is actually a lot harder than you might think
814, FUNNY, ### besides let me make this clear if we go to that church and i end up being able to see when we return i will beat you so hard if i can't play tomorrow
6249, NOTFUNNY, ### so i got going on it
10914, NOTFUNNY, ### so we packed this prototype of a sensor and we shipped it to bangladesh
15016, NOTFUNNY, ### it has two redundant oxygen tanks
800, FUNNY, ### this is south los angeles
3598, NOTFUNNY, ### lesson number three atalanta
3402, NOTFUNNY, ### actually the only way i feel comfortable wearing it is by pretending they are the robes of a kung fu warrior like li mu from that film crouching tiger hidden dragon
11011, NOTFUNNY, ### soft power is a concept invented by a harvard academic joseph nye a friend of mine
2989, NOTFUNNY, ### i was going to work on international development and then i took a turn and ended up here
617, NOTFUNNY, ### now we have to ask how these patterns in my brain that are associated with my memories and ideas are transmitted into your brains
9772, FUNNY, ### the official figures show actually it's nearer to three quarters
8093, NOTFUNNY, ### they wired them for lighting
11022, NOTFUNNY, ### and we're alive
12157, FUNNY, ### the total area of those is two greater london's worth of someone else's sahara and you'll need power lines all the way across spain and france to bring the power from the sahara to surrey
1579, FUNNY, ### and the robot hasn't quite learned the human value function properly so it doesn't understand the sentimental value of the cat outweighs the nutritional value of the cat
12297, NOTFUNNY, ### i was finally there although i had nothing to do i was a foreign expert
7984, FUNNY, ### now i would attempt to square a five digit number and i can but unfortunately most calculators cannot
3895, NOTFUNNY, ### but if we have no connection whatsoever with the worlds beyond the one we take for granted then we too run the risk of drying up inside
1090, FUNNY, ### as i try to get deeper this is slapping on a one person submarine suit some people call this my jacques cousteau meets woody allen moment
2273, FUNNY, ### great he said you got two years
6661, NOTFUNNY, ### so these stones a few kind of rules in the game number one you don't choose the stone the stone chooses you
13841, NOTFUNNY, ### we're here
8622, NOTFUNNY, ### so i went back to school and i studied my other world
14126, FUNNY, ### when we think about the dreams we have and the dent we want to leave in the universe it is striking to see how big of an overlap there is between the dreams that we have and projects that never happen
9692, FUNNY, ### it can talk to me it's conversant we have a language
5548, FUNNY, ### my mom was freaking out my dad ran around to put out the fire and of course my sister started recording a video
7022, NOTFUNNY, ### there's mexico
11333, NOTFUNNY, ### cynthia and i were there
2837, FUNNY, ### and i would please like the record to reflect today that i showed up for my part of the job
6521, FUNNY, ### it's the talk that i would have given if i had been famous first
11818, NOTFUNNY, ### but anyways it's these sorts of personal stories you know you read the about politics or about media and gossip and all these things
3864, FUNNY, ### so we don't have to make a dinosaur because we already have them
13094, FUNNY, ### i had no idea this plastic cup was so powerful
711, NOTFUNNY, ### and there are zero cures for these diseases
6033, NOTFUNNY, ### i have no idea
596, NOTFUNNY, ### you can't help but actually ripping that spider web apart
2141, FUNNY, ### and that poor country runs off that ledge does that cartoon thing and then drops
7903, NOTFUNNY, ### i mean even i could put up with a few more cloudy days if clouds saved the planet
9141, FUNNY, ### and when you're training for this sport you are not smiling
10638, NOTFUNNY, ### we live in places like this as if they're the most natural things in the world forgetting that because we're animals and that we need to eat we're actually as dependent on the natural world as our ancient ancestors were
5163, NOTFUNNY, ### so along with three co conspirators i spent nearly a decade observing up close and personal exceptional leaders of innovation
14940, NOTFUNNY, ### i used to be in the film business kind of and actually nicholas saw this when i was like and anyway so then they said no you have to make two and they have to fight
12487, NOTFUNNY, ### please help god
2010, FUNNY, ### it has also become a very popular backdrop for wedding photography
1653, FUNNY, ### psychologists have a great term for it
9629, NOTFUNNY, ### the chair could collapse if you sit on it the apple might be poison the dog might not bark and in fact this is my dog tessie who doesn't bark
7770, NOTFUNNY, ### in fact i call this the era of always on transformation
12401, FUNNY, ### and a record executive walked up to me and invited me to nashville tennessee to make a record
3473, NOTFUNNY, ### thank you very much and enjoy the conference
90, NOTFUNNY, ### procrastinating is a vice when it comes to productivity but it can be a virtue for creativity
5331, NOTFUNNY, ### so you refer the patient for hip replacement therapy
14383, FUNNY, ### and unfortunately it doesn't work so well anymore either
10465, FUNNY, ### i should say that my background my father was you know raised to be an episcopalian and republican but after one year of college he became an atheist and a democrat
13223, NOTFUNNY, ### and so this opens up the whole idea of looking at colony health
5248, NOTFUNNY, ### we know we're not always angry always jealous always generous
10315, FUNNY, ### that is exactly the behavior that the technology is built to trigger
539, FUNNY, ### in your backyard
1154, NOTFUNNY, ### that's already over different combinations
9328, FUNNY, ### i feel lucky in a way i've encountered this object
5319, FUNNY, ### i took and i made jerry slightly less attractive
11776, NOTFUNNY, ### i had been under the name patient dave and when i discovered this i just renamed myself e patient dave
13183, NOTFUNNY, ### they turn a social network from virtual to actual and kind of the century
3931, FUNNY, ### and i'd say i'm a little to the left like all the way to the left
2918, FUNNY, ### and that's one of the reasons why i think many of you here will be on the dark net fairly soon
5555, NOTFUNNY, ### today the action is really around machine learning
3705, FUNNY, ### he quotes one innovator who says the only time a physician and a physicist get together is when the physicist gets sick
1695, FUNNY, ### it's why they leave lights on around the house
12840, FUNNY, ### my publishers cut out the question mark
8047, FUNNY, ### it's so sad
11119, NOTFUNNY, ### you need proteins for muscles recovery
9900, NOTFUNNY, ### it's important to remember that we evolved
11102, FUNNY, ### his name is nostradamus although here the sun have made him look a little bit like sean connery
14825, FUNNY, ### but that wasn't the kind of robot my dad had in mind
9439, FUNNY, ### management teams seem increasingly disconnected from their staff
4114, FUNNY, ### with artificial intelligence not only have they not created artificial intelligence they haven't yet created artificial stupidity
4871, NOTFUNNY, ### so let me tell you my story
12811, NOTFUNNY, ### this disconnect is a problem that i'm trying to help solve
8583, FUNNY, ### her hebrew was not good and she later confessed that she thought that i had come to install the internet
7207, NOTFUNNY, ### now this brings us to the sorts of moves that people are apt to make in the moral sphere
10809, NOTFUNNY, ### the air a brisk with windchill and i could literally feel the blood trying to leave my hands feet and face and rush to protect my vital organs
15528, NOTFUNNY, ### so this is a newborn intensive care unit in nepal
12876, FUNNY, ### he threw his cigarette out as he got on the front and i climbed in the back
11237, NOTFUNNY, ### this made them want to leave the safety of their laptops and meet us in person to have real conversations with real people in real life
14708, FUNNY, ### and finally in german of course in german they have a word called which is the dread of getting what you want
13320, FUNNY, ### i get a great sense of comfort from looking at an excel spreadsheet even very simple ones
14887, FUNNY, ### no wonder that by age five i was a raging feminist although the term had not reached chile yet so nobody knew what the heck was wrong with me
1080, NOTFUNNY, ### the algorithm matched us up because we share a love of gadgets we share a love of math and data and music and so i agreed to go out with him
12, NOTFUNNY, ### each coral head consists of thousands of individual polyps
4994, FUNNY, ### he was adam smith not billy connolly not sean connery though he is very smart indeed
8049, NOTFUNNY, ### they brought women into the lab i think it was five women and outfitted them with cervical caps containing artificial semen
12358, NOTFUNNY, ### that means that ballplayer batted safely hit safely three times out of at bats
6140, NOTFUNNY, ### assembly lines were engineered to replace inconsistent human handiwork with machine perfection
836, NOTFUNNY, ### and the day before it was due he sent his presentation to his boss and his boss wrote him back and said nice presentation but the merger is canceled
11189, FUNNY, ### now i hope you will agree with me that these things i've just described to you each of them deserves some kind of prize
5398, FUNNY, ### if you're a woman please raise your hand if you've ever been told you're too aggressive at work
12501, FUNNY, ### so i should talk about art
3831, NOTFUNNY, ### unbeknownst to many of you the highway in the sky that i'm talking about here has been under construction for years
11006, FUNNY, ### and they scrawled on the windshield in a reference to the show's heroine long live
4628, FUNNY, ### she said that's nice dear
8300, FUNNY, ### but with people's names you can't change them
12836, NOTFUNNY, ### man okay
8601, NOTFUNNY, ### to counteract this we have to start creating new jobs that are less centered on the tasks that a person does and more focused on the skills that a person brings to work
1165, NOTFUNNY, ### perhaps one solution could be to introduce technology to students through creative projects
9901, NOTFUNNY, ### when we then find something very important like the bones of a human ancestor we begin to excavate it extremely carefully and slowly using dental picks and fine paintbrushes
4225, NOTFUNNY, ### the science budget is actually if you look to your left there's a purple set of blobs and then yellow set of blobs
4868, FUNNY, ### and as an example of unintended consequences my female company had to let the men in
12559, NOTFUNNY, ### on the left we see people dying we see people running for their lives
10441, NOTFUNNY, ### we had never seen our planet from this perspective before
13898, FUNNY, ### you're going to see things more like intelligent cars that really understand what traffic is what driving is and have learned that cars with the on for half a minute probably aren't going to turn
15479, NOTFUNNY, ### says the car should follow utilitarian ethics it should take the action that will minimize total harm even if that action will kill a bystander and even if that action will kill the passenger
11881, FUNNY, ### and then we have a chicken
4051, NOTFUNNY, ### they've used it between members of the police and members of community and they've used it between people of opposing political ideologies
8465, NOTFUNNY, ### we don't need any of that
927, NOTFUNNY, ### when i was in grade two i won a citywide speaking competition but nobody had ever said hey this kid's a good speaker
8702, FUNNY, ### and of course everybody wants their own tower
3903, NOTFUNNY, ### so he injects the first guy and then he's wiping the needle on his shirt and he injects the next guy
1466, FUNNY, ### now the researchers estimated that over the eight years they were tracking deaths americans died prematurely not from stress but from the belief that stress is bad for you
3151, FUNNY, ### i like it
7542, FUNNY, ### good luck to you
4770, FUNNY, ### can you imagine a car on a stick
2232, FUNNY, ### whenever i get to travel for work i try to find out where my drinking water comes from and where my poop and pee go
14935, NOTFUNNY, ### then this is a maker i think
14820, NOTFUNNY, ### and again a standard size real person so you get some sense of the scale
9140, FUNNY, ### a couple of years ago i was turning and i don't like being
7148, FUNNY, ### i could have told them that
11174, NOTFUNNY, ### at the end of the day after we left sun city i told alec that i didn't actually think that the stories of how these couples met were all that interesting
13299, NOTFUNNY, ### you're just in there watching the incredible subtle changes of color in the sky
3581, NOTFUNNY, ### peter wrote a whole book about this and in he did some new tests that were published
12043, FUNNY, ### there is nobody at the reception desk
12101, NOTFUNNY, ### we met her on our first family vacation
6374, FUNNY, ### not you but i feel this way often
6090, FUNNY, ### it's a common reaction
10908, FUNNY, ### so as good citizens we clean up the beaches and no he is not drinking alcohol and if he is i did not give it to him
5657, FUNNY, ### and so it will be quite a different shape
11308, NOTFUNNY, ### it's got an amazing user experience
10285, NOTFUNNY, ### and in his own words he looked like a freak
135, NOTFUNNY, ### and this should be presented factually straightforwardly with no particular spin to all of the children in the country
11329, NOTFUNNY, ### many of the people involved have special interests or short term interests that get them not thinking about what the implications of the trends are
610, FUNNY, ### i was thinking that the sun is kind of the ultimate alchemist
10404, FUNNY, ### so imagine a great white shark and a giant squid in the same bathroom
12183, FUNNY, ### what this is doing is we find a a direct collision we find a direct collision between availability and what's possible through availability and a fundamental human need which we've been hearing about a lot actually the need to create shared narratives
8922, FUNNY, ### they go on to jam innocent receivers for miles around you
6260, FUNNY, ### apparently i was in charge of making sure that no one stole the computers from the university
11524, NOTFUNNY, ### for me i like to think of it very simple like a surveillance system
14906, NOTFUNNY, ### these things occurred in my life in a way that was surprising especially to me
8507, FUNNY, ### and let's put aside the nigerian prince who's emailed you about getting the million out of the country
12792, NOTFUNNY, ### and we want everybody else to gaze out of the same window and see the exact same thing
14775, NOTFUNNY, ### only instead of doing it to sell products doing it to save lives
9561, NOTFUNNY, ### he was the key of the project
6417, NOTFUNNY, ### okay i cheated it was a mere seconds
10553, FUNNY, ### i was like david cries when you invite him to take a walk
3291, NOTFUNNY, ### i literally grew up with the ford motor company
8623, NOTFUNNY, ### i went to my first bag with the birch
11554, NOTFUNNY, ### don't forget to subtract the one
4521, FUNNY, ### anyway
11915, FUNNY, ### in this case those commas are well placed except that there should not be one between maniac and on
11349, FUNNY, ### you can see here that the police are confused about what to do with them
13101, NOTFUNNY, ### we'll be showing the video at the end but before we do i want to talk a little bit about what it is that they wanted
3194, FUNNY, ### and i can add in a blue and a dove and i have like don draper free
12031, NOTFUNNY, ### our diet consists in some part of animal proteins and at the moment most of us here get it from livestock from fish from game
2707, FUNNY, ### and here is the gray one
3075, FUNNY, ### the poor woman tried to translate this for him from them i extended my hands and stole you and here's the pickle and because you belong to them i returned my hands and left you
12656, FUNNY, ### and we have made some questionable choices for example in when the word of the year was to mean demoted
12857, NOTFUNNY, ### this was me on piano a genius drummer
10688, FUNNY, ### but it turns out that the key social identifier is how much you're going to talk in the car
13704, FUNNY, ### they never cooked
8095, FUNNY, ### make sure we are the bride you thought we were and not all the bullshit we put into our own ads
5242, NOTFUNNY, ### we think that if we could gather this and that all the conditions something that we say everything to be happy to have everything to be happy
9602, FUNNY, ### so i got a fulbright scholarship to just travel around africa for a year asking people why they were building which is a great job if you can get it
3453, NOTFUNNY, ### and i mean books everywhere around the house
14745, FUNNY, ### so this is basically the wall street protest that you see here
615, FUNNY, ### reporters call this making shit up
6872, FUNNY, ### i'm not sure what they're smoking
2649, NOTFUNNY, ### so a hundred surgeries later he looks at his mom and says mom please pray for me
2643, NOTFUNNY, ### so now what we do is take a genome we make maybe copies of it we cut all those copies up into little reads and then we sequence them massively parallel
6347, NOTFUNNY, ### we all get sick
2370, FUNNY, ### for instance just to get out of bed in the morning you tell yourself the story that your job is really important what you're doing is really important and maybe it is but i tell myself that story even when it's not
3417, NOTFUNNY, ### i never worked harder on anything never been challenged to this degree
11525, NOTFUNNY, ### if you don't attend to something you can't be aware of it
8561, FUNNY, ### we cannot only train women but forget about the men because the men are the real people who are giving women the hardest time
9318, FUNNY, ### mostly they have the faces of our parents
15185, FUNNY, ### he was quite fond of them actually
726, FUNNY, ### now here you'll find that even jesus has competition
6794, FUNNY, ### but guess what nobody will really care
14463, NOTFUNNY, ### we're in many many languages
9648, FUNNY, ### so our metaphors equate the experience of loving someone to extreme violence or illness
5323, NOTFUNNY, ### here's another one
11047, FUNNY, ### so would you mind giving us your best and final offer my response how about nothing we didn't have high hopes for that outcome
10, FUNNY, ### that's because this used to be my home and office on maui
12032, FUNNY, ### one of the stories she told was that if you eat a lot of salt all of the blood rushes up your legs through your body and shoots out the top of your head killing you instantly
9662, NOTFUNNY, ### but the good news is it doesn't always last that long usually from a few months to a couple of years
10535, NOTFUNNY, ### this changes all rules
5723, NOTFUNNY, ### this is john hunter hospital
5912, FUNNY, ### he said if the only tool you have is a hammer everything starts to look like a nail
4486, FUNNY, ### i just thought it was you know completely boring
1679, FUNNY, ### that joke never got old
14789, NOTFUNNY, ### thank you for making your site
15290, FUNNY, ### people were eating boxed lunches on tables and there was a sad band playing music or a band playing sad music probably both
5023, FUNNY, ### they're tasty and they make your pee smell funny
11825, NOTFUNNY, ### this is all i have a couple of facts about somebody
2095, FUNNY, ### i don't do this in the restaurant because it would be bizarre but i have to i did it once and that's how i learned it was bizarre
15364, FUNNY, ### because this is treating your audience like a moron
2987, NOTFUNNY, ### okay when you hear the click this is when the energy starts to emit and you see a little lesion form inside the phantom
15118, FUNNY, ### it's a big number
13753, NOTFUNNY, ### and when parts of your job are not easy or fun you kind of look for an excuse not to do them
14066, NOTFUNNY, ### the challenge was to build our own shelter with whatever we could find
184, FUNNY, ### it is in our to be curious
1082, NOTFUNNY, ### very few of us have the ability to be totally and brutally honest with ourselves
5900, FUNNY, ### i don't need a husband who wants to be
721, NOTFUNNY, ### and we're going to do all of that in minutes i promise
9246, FUNNY, ### but if you're not careful about how you choose you wind up with this
4573, NOTFUNNY, ### now we're talking about a continent that is not poor

5675, NOTFUNNY, ### i just joined the points
9659, NOTFUNNY, ### and to think this through i want to focus on one metaphor in particular which is the idea of love as madness
11949, FUNNY, ### inside all of us panting i sat a moment and i heard rafi telling his father father you can run faster than me
6193, NOTFUNNY, ### it knows exactly where it wants to go and it heads off in that particular direction
15384, NOTFUNNY, ### but when you get down to the bottom of the ocean that's where things get really strange
10954, NOTFUNNY, ### now this is a real proposition and there are companies out there that really are offering this investment but my interest in it is quite different
2464, FUNNY, ### red
8911, FUNNY, ### we have charted our love for our child over time
10355, NOTFUNNY, ### i want to show you something
3325, NOTFUNNY, ### and i have a passion for images and for words
1861, FUNNY, ### it's not long after you plant a garden that you start to say hey i need to start to learn how to cook
10139, NOTFUNNY, ### and the scientists can measure the heat buildup much more precisely now at all depths deep mid ocean the first few hundred meters
5482, FUNNY, ### all right which means when it comes to perception we're all like this frog
12907, FUNNY, ### but all i learned about work life balance from that year was that i found it quite easy to balance work and life when i didn't have any work
9239, FUNNY, ### your call may be recorded so that they can collect the funniest dumb user stories and pass them around on a cd
3504, NOTFUNNY, ### we're on this curve and the graphics are getting so ridiculously better
14648, FUNNY, ### but it didn't work out
8430, FUNNY, ### and they also have learned how to lose gracefully without avenging the winner
11056, NOTFUNNY, ### now this species here is so new i'm not even allowed to tell you its name yet but i can tell you it's a new species from mexico and it's probably already extinct
10620, NOTFUNNY, ### i'll give you some examples
672, NOTFUNNY, ### but it's still something to be aware of
9621, NOTFUNNY, ### as you can see my legs are
3861, FUNNY, ### and they didn't just all chase jeeps around
3729, NOTFUNNY, ### human technologies have tended to be large flat with right angles stiff made of metal
2884, NOTFUNNY, ### now at some point i was in hawaii i like to hike and surf and do all that weird stuff and i was making a collage for my ma
1166, FUNNY, ### back in the and when i was growing up little girls were supposed to be kind and thoughtful and pretty and gentle and soft and we were supposed to fit into roles that were sort of shadowy really not quite clear what we were supposed to be
14832, NOTFUNNY, ### and a few years later he was diagnosed with cancer
83, FUNNY, ### you celebrate thomas edison for pioneering the light bulb
12904, NOTFUNNY, ### so let me introduce you to the jitney
8192, NOTFUNNY, ### i find it interesting that for every one dollar we spend however on early childhood education like head start we save dollars on stuff like incarceration in the future
642, FUNNY, ### that's what we're giving them
496, FUNNY, ### dumbest idea ever
3763, NOTFUNNY, ### they need to be stopped because this is a cruel farce
4356, NOTFUNNY, ### it was a big hit when it reached stores
9878, NOTFUNNY, ### and then a psychologist alice did this wonderful experiment
127, FUNNY, ### i give him an a on this
4090, FUNNY, ### basically it's virtual reality circa
358, FUNNY, ### the current head of the paris said recently it takes great physical strength to conduct a symphony and women are too weak
9799, NOTFUNNY, ### and stanford university has been doing research for five years now to document how playing a game with an idealized changes how we think and act in real life making us more courageous more ambitious more committed to our goals
3509, FUNNY, ### they didn't come so i bought bigger pillows
9220, NOTFUNNY, ### in other words they're meant to prevent us from decomposing
11757, FUNNY, ### and the thing is i didn't make it into that presentation because i can't read to you anything that they said more or less
10681, NOTFUNNY, ### let me just give you an example from a recent study that we conducted
4126, FUNNY, ### i don't know how many worms were in there but i've got some heavy karma coming i tell you
5698, FUNNY, ### so please be period positive
14243, FUNNY, ### it's like brad pitt says in fight club too often we're working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don't need
6005, FUNNY, ### all the time they wear it at dinner they wear it to bed
13910, FUNNY, ### until recently whenever i took part in an international conference or festival i would be usually one of the more depressed speakers
8328, FUNNY, ### that one's actually true
7091, NOTFUNNY, ### but they loved the hell out of me
6067, NOTFUNNY, ### and part of the problem is i think that the dominant culture of education has come to focus on not teaching and learning but testing
5706, FUNNY, ### they made his silly outfits like this and they did his silly or whatever
13612, FUNNY, ### we'll read a text we'll talk about it we'll have a potluck dinner
13766, FUNNY, ### it doesn't surprise me that in this climate many of our institutions for the provision of health care start to look a heck of a lot like jiffy lube
12238, FUNNY, ### the launch is the difficult part you've got to hold it high up over your head and you start walking forward and just let go of it and you can control it like that
609, NOTFUNNY, ### and one of my favorite robots is leonardo
8310, FUNNY, ### and b i hate them and i'm terrified of the power they hold
6131, NOTFUNNY, ### or if you want to paint you can paint it blue throughout because every roof which you see in this picture collects rainwater drops and deposit in the rooms
4008, NOTFUNNY, ### non negligible so we don't live in an entirely local or national world but very very far from the percent level that you would expect and the very simple
4428, NOTFUNNY, ### and their kids will be saved and their grandchildren will be saved and this passes on
4054, FUNNY, ### and in that row house i started manchester guild and i learned very quickly that wherever there are episcopalians there's money in very close proximity

3954, NOTFUNNY, ### he sees an intruder in his territory and it's coming all the time and he's there so there is no end to it
8569, NOTFUNNY, ### it gave me confidence
9550, FUNNY, ### he was always singing and making jokes and his daughters and sons saved me from his bull who wanted to attack me on the fourth floor
16, NOTFUNNY, ### but physics does tell us what particles can be produced
928, NOTFUNNY, ### entrepreneurs are people we have a lot of them in this room who have ideas and passions or see these needs in the world and decide to stand up and do it
14882, FUNNY, ### my back is always straight and i don't make old people's noises
13064, FUNNY, ### we are looking down in the archive and when we are down into there is only austria and sweden that can produce numbers
3882, NOTFUNNY, ### we started out with a wolf like creature and we ended up with a maltese
839, NOTFUNNY, ### and if you remember the story about was punished by the gods to push the same rock up a hill and when he almost got to the end the rock would roll over and he would have to start again
14622, FUNNY, ### months later she was joking that her husband had threatened to pull her out of the classes as he found out that his now literate wife was going through his phone text messages
2514, FUNNY, ### if it's gone it's gone and if you're really lucky you might get something growing back from the bottom
15361, FUNNY, ### i just become
8445, NOTFUNNY, ### because the world would truly be a different place if north were down
14311, NOTFUNNY, ### she is the absolute worst
2444, FUNNY, ### and then when my mom noticed she got really upset
13045, NOTFUNNY, ### number three use two to three basic colors
709, FUNNY, ### so hit it again
6618, FUNNY, ### after all there's a strong correlation between water and fishing and for some there's a strong correlation between fishing and beer
10188, FUNNY, ### you are the worldwide number one trending topic on
1269, NOTFUNNY, ### ok then you've got to combine them because then you have the whole spatial palette in front of you
15533, NOTFUNNY, ### those decisions are made by the ministry of health or by foreign donors and it just kind of shows up
15495, FUNNY, ### and this also happened so i have five daughters now
13959, FUNNY, ### and i've also told quite a few of my patients that if they could bring into their relationships one tenth of the boldness the imagination and the verve that they put into their affairs they probably would never need to see me
15520, NOTFUNNY, ### the three keys are easy to eat so this is cooked already so easy to eat
8177, NOTFUNNY, ### so i decided to close it down for one year
13878, FUNNY, ### we've got some of the most incredible video of titanic that's ever been seen and we're not going to show you any of it
13964, NOTFUNNY, ### when marriage was an economic enterprise infidelity threatened our economic security
4485, FUNNY, ### and as you get older and more decrepit you sort of inch along on this sort of depressing long staircase leading you into oblivion
540, NOTFUNNY, ### and then within plant protection i came into the discipline of biological pest control which we actually define as the use of living organisms to reduce populations of noxious plant pests
8917, NOTFUNNY, ### and of course they're not always crying and screaming but with three boys there's a decent probability that at least one of them will not be himself exactly as he should
667, NOTFUNNY, ### ok now a six rock is very large
3163, FUNNY, ### this person did a derivative and then they smiled
2457, NOTFUNNY, ### and indeed this is actually true for most scientists as well outside of their own specialties
9077, FUNNY, ### but the reason i like to show the shot is because you can see that he's about to solve this problem
1602, FUNNY, ### my hair used to be straight
14837, NOTFUNNY, ### so we got a chance to take the tele actor to the awards in san francisco
4836, FUNNY, ### you're not even going to be able to answer her questions
6666, NOTFUNNY, ### what's happening there's too much darkness
14332, FUNNY, ### in tel aviv they come to my concerts
784, NOTFUNNY, ### and all of a sudden indian sport had awakened to the reality that you can source the best product for the best price anywhere in the world
4568, FUNNY, ### that characterization in my view is even more charitable
10461, NOTFUNNY, ### he had friends in high places who assured him that he was of great value to the economy
11516, FUNNY, ### if i did it slowly it'd be on your shoulder
7829, FUNNY, ### they got someone to come in and saw off the shoes
6456, NOTFUNNY, ### and the numbers here are really rather staggering
9021, FUNNY, ### that's how i hailed taxicabs
11167, FUNNY, ### i think he was drunk
1329, NOTFUNNY, ### that was pretty much just for convenience so they could tell just at a glance which was which
10363, FUNNY, ### this is why spouses in happy marriages tend to think that their husband or wife looks much better than anyone else thinks that they do
1974, NOTFUNNY, ### those people don't need to be able to write beautifully by hand
9081, NOTFUNNY, ### this was absolutely key for us
4242, FUNNY, ### and so i started doing this regularly
1284, FUNNY, ### and she said and where do um where do human women like where do women lay their eggs and i said well funny you should ask
9870, FUNNY, ### it will squirt you all around and you can stay in that shower for hours and not waste water by the way because it the same dirty water
7880, FUNNY, ### not much has changed by the way
1547, NOTFUNNY, ### hey hey hey hey
10496, FUNNY, ### seven years ago an even faster and cheaper american manufacturing technology was used to make this little carbon fiber test part which doubles as a carbon cap
1093, NOTFUNNY, ### as we go down underwater after about meters all the red is gone
4903, NOTFUNNY, ### that's how they market me
14843, FUNNY, ### not small things many of us in this audience write books are writing books we always make mistakes that's why we're glad to have second editions correct the mistakes
490, NOTFUNNY, ### they constitute experiments from which we ourselves may be able to learn
3203, NOTFUNNY, ### it could show text and after we waited a bit we had these things called images
4615, NOTFUNNY, ### when this picture appeared that well known scientific journal the new york times wrote in its editorial mars is uninteresting
580, NOTFUNNY, ### so my interest in cheating started when enron came on the scene exploded all of a sudden and i started thinking about what is happening here
8028, FUNNY, ### here's another example
3464, FUNNY, ### it is the goal and i should be so shallow to say that this year the destination was even sweeter than the journey
3045, NOTFUNNY, ### she took hold of what i now know to be my clitoris she took that rusty knife and started cutting away inch by inch
9191, FUNNY, ### so i know my stuff
12965, FUNNY, ### i grabbed a piece of graph paper i'm a physicist
9580, FUNNY, ### i particularly like the little penguin in the back
8510, FUNNY, ### you dominated the first group
11463, FUNNY, ### and all around the world this is how products are being distributed so for instance in one street market on rua de maro in so paulo brazil you can buy fake designer glasses
8952, FUNNY, ### and then there was this mister splashy pants
10856, NOTFUNNY, ### now it's looking at me showing that it's listening
2661, NOTFUNNY, ### and paper of course wicks fluid as you know paper cloth drop wine on the tablecloth and the wine wicks all over everything
2053, NOTFUNNY, ### lets people rent out their own cars to their friends and neighbors
53, FUNNY, ### i was having dinner with my colleague danny the nobel prize winner and i somewhat told him about having broken my window and you know forgotten my passport and danny shared with me that he'd been practicing something called prospective hindsight
8716, NOTFUNNY, ### the documentation and the hands on teaching methodology is also open source and released as the creative commons
13097, FUNNY, ### and as if that wasn't enough all of these incredibly complicating things right they wanted it in one shot
2117, FUNNY, ### and then this guy duke the dumpster stole my entire shtick
1404, FUNNY, ### let's call him don too
12082, FUNNY, ### a lot of experts were saying it was impossible and my mum certainly wasn't very keen on the idea
15304, FUNNY, ### it's up there with thumbs and standing upright and language as one of the things that got our species out of the trees and into the shopping mall
8446, NOTFUNNY, ### but i do believe that while maps don't show you where you will go in your life they show you where you might go
4020, NOTFUNNY, ### we make them bigger to create those types of enhanced videos or magnified videos that actually show us those changes
13218, FUNNY, ### what i'd like you to do is just really quickly is just sort of nod to the person on your right and then nod to the person on your left
15163, FUNNY, ### as a result i am legally blind though i prefer partially sighted because it's more optimistic
6020, NOTFUNNY, ### i got back to my local station and i began the walk home
11587, NOTFUNNY, ### please raise your hand if you'd say you're libertarian
4891, FUNNY, ### wharton
1815, FUNNY, ### but that being said it's a very good media opportunity
14432, NOTFUNNY, ### so faking your brain going wrong is evidence that your brain has gone wrong
858, FUNNY, ### i in fact graduated in the part of my law school class that made the top possible
12962, FUNNY, ### at first the first thing i thought was i want to run away
4483, NOTFUNNY, ### there are so many things you can do but ultimately this is about something really simple
972, FUNNY, ### and it's so simple
3853, NOTFUNNY, ### people with more positive feelings towards aging walk faster they do better on memory tests they heal quicker and they live longer
11384, FUNNY, ### i'm going to show you some stuff that not only has not been declassified but has now been reclassified
3905, NOTFUNNY, ### yeah by sharing needles
11583, FUNNY, ### suppose you learn that this particular breed is independent minded and relates to its owner as a friend and an equal well if you are a liberal you say hey that's great because liberals like to say fetch please
13091, NOTFUNNY, ### so this is an image of diana looking at camilla kissing her husband and this was a sequence of images
15254, FUNNY, ### one is a supermarket standard white bread pre packaged which i'm told is called a
6403, NOTFUNNY, ### i loved watching planes barrel over our holiday home in the countryside
14174, NOTFUNNY, ### and it's really a of urban population rising biodiversity plummeting and also of course sea levels rising and climate changing
6582, NOTFUNNY, ### if the internet is a global phenomenon if we live in a global village it's because there are cables underneath the ocean cables like this
14799, FUNNY, ### so we'll report on that later to see how well this goes
6712, NOTFUNNY, ### and these reports are pretty simple it has all the diseases that the patient has all the drugs that they're on and all the adverse events or side effects that they experience
4424, NOTFUNNY, ### and as you're thinking of other things we've been doing think about twins
15291, FUNNY, ### enigma number one how do you create jobs in america in a global economy number two very quickly how do you solve global climate change when we don't even have a national energy policy in this country and when gridlock in congress seems to be the norm in fact there was a poll that was done recently and the pollster compared congress's approval ratings to a number of other unpleasant things and it was found in fact that congress's approval rating is worse than cockroaches lice the band root canals and donald trump
2124, NOTFUNNY, ### he tried to kill himself in grade when a kid who could still go home to mom and dad had the audacity to tell him get over it
8753, NOTFUNNY, ### he said he heard suspicious laughter
4558, NOTFUNNY, ### on one hand india is a hindu society without a tradition of homophobia
9817, NOTFUNNY, ### he probably has a queen bee tied to his chin and the other bees are attracted to it
1078, NOTFUNNY, ### so i have two possible strategies at this point i'm sort of figuring out
13148, NOTFUNNY, ### they said it was the agrarian calendar and people had but let me tell you why that doesn't make sense
1156, NOTFUNNY, ### they brought in companies
12188, FUNNY, ### what you have to do is identify which of these shapes is called and which is called kiki
3408, FUNNY, ### radio
3211, NOTFUNNY, ### and that's kind of awkward
4106, NOTFUNNY, ### america was jolted by the anti vietnam movement the civil rights movement
1482, FUNNY, ### this was his horseradish
12936, NOTFUNNY, ### well i haven't seen the original studies and i can't comment on that meta analysis but i would like to see more studies done along those lines
7702, NOTFUNNY, ### but it took us more than years to finally poke inside a human cell take out this crystal it and read it for the first time
10262, NOTFUNNY, ### when the arrived in north america you had two choices you either fight back and engage or you could take off
14435, NOTFUNNY, ### so whenever he said anything to me that just seemed kind of non psychopathic i thought to myself well i'm not going to put that in my book
3604, FUNNY, ### it's particularly horrible in la
10320, NOTFUNNY, ### i was one of the first people into belgrade when there was a revolution in serbia
6921, NOTFUNNY, ### she's some other woman pretending to be my mother
3208, NOTFUNNY, ### at you're not allowed to draw from an image
9948, FUNNY, ### i'm calling this the great unwind
7966, FUNNY, ### and if it looks like this picture is out of focus because it was taken in a hurry here's why
645, NOTFUNNY, ### we already saw that briefly yesterday
7961, NOTFUNNY, ### and one night i'm riding the uptown local train
1071, FUNNY, ### they all looked really great which turned out to be in sharp contrast to what i had
11948, FUNNY, ### maybe some of them are here now
15482, NOTFUNNY, ### and we vary the ages and even the species of the different victims
2854, FUNNY, ### right if you could check into the ads you'd have a great experience
4841, NOTFUNNY, ### well some of you are laughing
1754, NOTFUNNY, ### and the way to it for me was through artistic means
98, FUNNY, ### but perhaps my old friend lyndon johnson might have put it in less noble fashion better to have your enemies inside the tent out than outside the tent in
9172, NOTFUNNY, ### so we have to think as if we are actually on mars with the
8832, NOTFUNNY, ### it shows very well that eyes can hear and this is interesting to me because technology allows us to present sound to the eyes in ways that accentuate the strength of the eyes for seeing sound such as the removal of time
2094, FUNNY, ### so you can imagine it's a very peaceful quiet meal
1043, FUNNY, ### on the left you have rupert murdoch or the bbc
3440, NOTFUNNY, ### it was very important
13203, NOTFUNNY, ### and have to do something with it
12012, FUNNY, ### because it's an arranged marriage not a love marriage
10083, FUNNY, ### welcome to the robotics mechanisms laboratory at virginia tech
618, NOTFUNNY, ### and as you can see in this particular brain area the responses are going up and down as the story is unfolding
8301, FUNNY, ### so after a few instances of this steve happily became seve and we got through it that way
7017, FUNNY, ### and that doesn't come easy from the mouth of a swedish public health professor
3245, FUNNY, ### i realized that my real competition was the beaver
14682, NOTFUNNY, ### first find rocks of the right age
11807, FUNNY, ### you can laugh this is ok
968, FUNNY, ### and among those was liking a page for curly fries
9865, FUNNY, ### it's so much fun i have it in my house but i have it in the entryway i don't use it to make juice
11044, FUNNY, ### this last year is this going to matter in a decade or this or this really is this going to matter in or years okay that was kind of cool
9803, FUNNY, ### frank gehry said to me my mother pushed me
10080, NOTFUNNY, ### for a couple of years i had noticed a rash on the sides of elizabeth's neck that looked like prickly heat
5137, FUNNY, ### who really wants to eat chocolate covered broccoli none of you
6320, NOTFUNNY, ### just certain
253, FUNNY, ### it may not be good action but we would take action
12480, NOTFUNNY, ### that really is how humor works
14779, FUNNY, ### i used to work with a bunch of uptight religious people so sometimes i didn't wear panties and just had a big smile and chuckled to myself
7722, NOTFUNNY, ### and imagine if through new scientific advances we were just beginning to understand its importance to how we think of ourselves
2324, NOTFUNNY, ### consciously or unconsciously
8296, FUNNY, ### i'm pretty sure that i'm grown now
9045, NOTFUNNY, ### before it can be used for internal fertilization its mechanical behavior has to change in a really dramatic fashion
11081, NOTFUNNY, ### and it's pressure sensitive to the forces both in the plane of the screen x y and z at least in one direction we couldn't figure out how to come in the other direction
6365, FUNNY, ### yep awesome
6852, FUNNY, ### i don't know if y'all noticed that
10006, FUNNY, ### from work or from home they took the day off and nothing worked in iceland
10834, NOTFUNNY, ### and it uses training to shape their behavior over four stages
1630, FUNNY, ### now go to the equivalent in london in parliament square and you will see that the monument to david lloyd george contains three words david lloyd george
11160, NOTFUNNY, ### i don't remember making a single speech on climate change
4154, FUNNY, ### but also more recently we started acquiring video games and that's where all hell broke loose in a really interesting way
4783, NOTFUNNY, ### these new ideas for materials will come into play in probably a decade
2587, NOTFUNNY, ### no keys no memory card the sealed you can't replace it
12878, FUNNY, ### it says ben lacks sufficient impetus to achieve anything worthwhile
11400, FUNNY, ### and i can remember actually when i got the phone call to congratulate us to say the movie was a go i actually threw up
5968, NOTFUNNY, ### they got their title of respectability
15277, NOTFUNNY, ### they all have an idea for a video game even if they're not experts
14695, NOTFUNNY, ### it's stunning
10654, NOTFUNNY, ### well the act of drawing airplanes led me to when i had the opportunity to choose a course in school led me to sign up for aeronautical engineering
4706, NOTFUNNY, ### this is where my life was turned upside down
6907, FUNNY, ### right now you try using the freudian explanation there
15505, NOTFUNNY, ### it's kind of a book about questions questions about simplicity
6282, FUNNY, ### here's the current training model
489, FUNNY, ### you are the people to whom my talk will be of practical value
12580, FUNNY, ### i had the chance a little while back to ride in the autonomous car which is as cool as it sounds
9011, FUNNY, ### to give you a sense of the experience the article was called i think you're fat
4954, FUNNY, ### so that's when the chinese moved in saw a market opportunity and took over
3996, NOTFUNNY, ### and that's not a good experience when you're used to experiences like this
13380, FUNNY, ### computer a man riding a horse down a street next to a building
14733, FUNNY, ### i'm not sure how well the chimpanzees read it but they surely seemed interested in the book
402, NOTFUNNY, ### but this glacier caved into the water and a seal got on it
5755, NOTFUNNY, ### one of the most sophisticated sensors a fly has is a structure called the
10448, FUNNY, ### i gotta get back out my baseball ability here

14446, FUNNY, ### and now it's in there somewhere
3911, FUNNY, ### i do think he's a moral freak and i think he'll be undone by that fact the fact that he just doesn't know anything about anything and is about it
12932, NOTFUNNY, ### good
134, NOTFUNNY, ### and as with the cow there's a mixture of evolutionary design designed by natural selection itself and intelligent design more or less intelligent design and redesigned by human beings who are trying to redesign their religions
3597, NOTFUNNY, ### remember he did a horrible thing condemned for all time to roll this rock up it would roll back down roll back up roll back down
10956, FUNNY, ### at that stage i just wanted to abandon the research but it turns out that democracy is a little bit more complicated than that
