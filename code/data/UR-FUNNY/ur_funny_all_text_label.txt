1, 1 ### the cat likes this version better
3, 1 ### a lot of people in this room make a good living pushing them around
4, 1 ### there is also a very weak force called rather the weak force
5, 1 ### and of course bad for me personally
7, 1 ### i've tried the best i can to live a balanced life
9, 1 ### now it's one of the greatest mysteries in the universe to my parents how i managed to survive all that time without engaging in anything resembling full time employment
10, 1 ### that's because this used to be my home and office on maui
11, 1 ### i don't know if i'll be able to make this any clearer
12, 0 ### each coral head consists of thousands of individual polyps
13, 0 ### that he was in all these other locations as well but experiencing them as separate individuals
15, 0 ### and things can happen only if these interactions are perfectly balanced
16, 0 ### but physics does tell us what particles can be produced
17, 0 ### these four different forces interact with matter according to the corresponding charges that each particle has
18, 0 ### and it seems strange that nature would have so many elementary particles
19, 0 ### if we spread out the and weak charge and plot the charges of particles in this two dimensional charge space the electric charge is where these particles sit along the vertical direction
20, 0 ### so the electromagnetic and weak forces are described by this pattern of particle charges in two dimensional space
22, 0 ### and strong interactions are happening millions of times each second in every atom of our bodies holding the atomic nuclei together
24, 1 ### come on you have dictators ruling the world population is growing by millions there's no more fish in the sea the north pole is melting and as the last ted prize winner said we're all becoming fat
25, 1 ### oh all right
26, 1 ### then when the photo left the frame was still there
27, 1 ### so he went to the church of nativity and brought back an old ladder that was so old that it could have seen jesus being born
29, 1 ### oh that guy just moved
30, 1 ### and the photos kept traveling even without us
31, 1 ### so now my wish is i wish for you to stand up for what you care about by participating in a global art project and together we'll turn the world inside out
32, 0 ### i was doing graffiti writing my name everywhere using the city as a canvas
33, 0 ### and i framed it with color so you would not confuse it with advertising
35, 0 ### it was the only one i had at that time
36, 0 ### and we go from thug images who've been stolen and distorted by the media who's now proudly taking over his own image
38, 0 ### we called the project face face
39, 0 ### when we did the wall we did the palestinian side
40, 1 ### an angry viewer put his two screens together and snapped that picture and that one too went viral and since then people call turkish media the penguin media
41, 0 ### it was everywhere in the park well along with a lot of tear gas
43, 0 ### it was there that one night i woke up from a dream and i saw that the stars were also reflected on the water
45, 1 ### that's a good point
46, 1 ### you never want to go back to black and white
48, 0 ### it was the first time the story of stonewall had been told to a national audience
49, 0 ### they lived in cubicles the size of prison cells covered with chicken wire so you couldn't jump from one room into the next
50, 1 ### so the next morning when i woke up on too little sleep worrying about the hole in the window and a mental note that i had to call my contractor and the freezing temperatures and the meetings i had upcoming in europe and you know with all the in my brain my thinking was cloudy but i didn't know it was cloudy because my thinking was cloudy
51, 1 ### it wasn't until i got to the airport check in counter that i realized i didn't have my passport
52, 1 ### well i had a lot of time to think during those eight hours and no sleep
53, 1 ### i was having dinner with my colleague danny the nobel prize winner and i somewhat told him about having broken my window and you know forgotten my passport and danny shared with me that he'd been practicing something called prospective hindsight
54, 0 ### i thought about calling a locksmith at least i had my cellphone but at midnight it could take a while for a locksmith to show up and it was cold
55, 0 ### some of them are obvious some of them are not so obvious
56, 0 ### and if you're wondering somebody actually did the experiment where they cut off the olfactory sense of the squirrels and they could still find their nuts
57, 0 ### if you designate a spot and you're scrupulous about it your things will always be there when you look for them
59, 1 ### so there's only one sensible way to go from there you get four
61, 1 ### if you notice we've got five engines here not to be put off by the fact one was in maintenance still had a go
62, 1 ### this was a blind alley
63, 1 ### again struck that one off
66, 0 ### after a while the jet engine noise is a bit annoying
68, 0 ### as it comes past you start picking up speed and see if we can intercept from the rear not the front that would be a mistake and then try and land in the back
69, 0 ### so it's a tribute to him
70, 1 ### and they ended up naming the company parker
71, 1 ### i just feel that a few months ahead of time
72, 1 ### eventually it got so out of hand that a local newspaper came and did a story on the dark side of nintendo starring me
75, 1 ### they didn't fill out my survey
76, 1 ### so i and like any self respecting i woke up early the next morning and i made a to do list with steps on how to procrastinate
77, 1 ### they had backup plans lined up and that made me doubt that they had the courage to be original because i expected that originals would look something like this
78, 1 ### let me show you this is a depiction of how the creative process works for most of us
82, 1 ### when you feel doubt don't let it go
83, 1 ### you celebrate thomas edison for pioneering the light bulb
84, 0 ### not exactly
85, 0 ### originals are nonconformists people who not only have new ideas but take action to champion them
86, 0 ### now you are all intimately familiar with the mind of a
87, 0 ### why is this maybe original people just have bad work habits
88, 0 ### i call it thinking
89, 0 ### what about martin luther king jr
90, 0 ### procrastinating is a vice when it comes to productivity but it can be a virtue for creativity
91, 0 ### look at a classic study of over product categories comparing the first movers who created the market with the who introduced something different and better
92, 0 ### it motivates you to test to experiment to refine just like did
94, 0 ### if you look across industries and ask people about their biggest idea their most important suggestion percent of them stayed silent instead of speaking up
95, 0 ### even the three icons of classical music bach beethoven mozart had to generate hundreds and hundreds of compositions to come up with a much smaller number of masterpieces
96, 0 ### they procrastinate
98, 1 ### but perhaps my old friend lyndon johnson might have put it in less noble fashion better to have your enemies inside the tent out than outside the tent in
99, 1 ### for in the months leading up to my selection like many young people i'd been active in the anti vietnam war movement and had written an article against lyndon johnson which unfortunately came out in the new republic two days after the dance in the white house
100, 1 ### but they were great nonetheless
101, 1 ### and then he said you remind me of my mother
103, 1 ### because at first i'd be so excited i would blurt out the dodgers won or the dodgers lost which took much of the drama of this two hour telling away
104, 1 ### but as i left that night i was certain that somehow i'd traded the life of my everlasting soul for this one night with roy campanella
108, 0 ### whereas to pursue all three with equal dedication is to make possible a life filled not only with achievement but with serenity
109, 0 ### no schooling was possible for him except a few weeks here a few weeks there
110, 0 ### literature allowed him to transcend his surroundings
112, 0 ### he was so depressed that friends worried he was suicidal
113, 0 ### everyone is broken by life ernest hemingway once said but some people are stronger in the broken places
114, 0 ### these are the qualities we should be looking for in our candidates in
117, 0 ### he was stunned
118, 1 ### like
120, 1 ### oh gwen do you recall how i forgot my purple marker and you were unable to color the sheep well if you keep reading starting with it says oh by the way the sheep can be left blank
121, 0 ### it's certainly true for me
122, 0 ### i test your ability to solve
123, 0 ### order
125, 1 ### they could outsource all their problems protection from predators food finding
127, 1 ### i give him an a on this
128, 1 ### al gore eat your heart out
129, 1 ### every time you read it or say it you make another copy in your brain
131, 0 ### this is the ancestor of cattle
133, 0 ### and you might say it's about the reverse engineering of religions
134, 0 ### and as with the cow there's a mixture of evolutionary design designed by natural selection itself and intelligent design more or less intelligent design and redesigned by human beings who are trying to redesign their religions
135, 0 ### and this should be presented factually straightforwardly with no particular spin to all of the children in the country
136, 1 ### so i'm not going to talk about that
137, 1 ### having said that i outlined my talk about five minutes ago
139, 1 ### but although i would love to talk about with you i'm not going to
140, 1 ### those of you who are physicists i hear you rolling your eyes but bear with me
142, 1 ### and i'm thinking oh yeah the square root of the length is proportional to its period
144, 0 ### nor am i going to talk about what i think are obvious statements from my first book silicon snake oil or my second book nor am i going to talk about why i believe computers don't belong in schools
145, 0 ### no don't ask somebody who's writing code
146, 0 ### certainly all of us can imagine these cool new things that are going to be there
148, 0 ### right away i hope that all of your eyes glaze over
151, 1 ### that's me riding on my bicycle
152, 1 ### i plan to finish this project in the next to years
153, 0 ### and i was spending a lot of time way too much time in front of a screen for work that would be presented on a screen and i had this great need to get my hands back on the work again
154, 0 ### it is an imaginary super magnified medical device that fits around the optic nerve
156, 1 ### so we sent the listening post's marcela pizarro to oslo to find out what it is but first a warning viewers may find some of the images in the following report disappointing
158, 1 ### then a new tunnel
159, 1 ### thousands of people just jumped on the train on our second channel like this
160, 1 ### this guy for instance he's head of research at the university in and i will show you a piece of cloth this one
162, 1 ### it made it possible for us to take close up pictures of people away like this one
163, 1 ### he kept watching because something might happen though it probably won't
165, 1 ### i've got my eye on a wildly popular program from norway called national firewood night which consisted of mostly people in parkas chatting and chopping in the woods and then eight hours of a fire burning in a fireplace
166, 1 ### in fact nothing counts and death is coming for us all
167, 0 ### and that's the norwegian media in a nutshell not much drama
168, 0 ### where do you get your ideas in the lunchroom
170, 0 ### so that's strong and living tv
171, 0 ### so when we sat in our editing room we watched this picture it's all l station we saw this journalist
173, 0 ### this is my sketch from february and when you give this sketch to professional people in the norwegian broadcasting company you get some cool stuff back
174, 0 ### it was also a great success on social media
176, 0 ### this is a picture from last summer when we traveled the coast again for seven weeks
177, 0 ### so this is actually the whole running order for hours just written on one page
178, 1 ### that would be like getting hungry at night and having to flip through the whole phone book from cover to cover pausing at every line just to find the nearest pizza joint
181, 1 ### and all of this while sitting on the toilet
182, 1 ### isn't that mind blowing i bet you will never look at that black truffle again without thinking of its genes
183, 1 ### most of us may not yet be diagnosing genetic conditions in our kitchen sinks or doing at home paternity testing
184, 1 ### it is in our to be curious
186, 0 ### they can jump right into the pen and swab their noses and mouths with a little filter paper place that little filter paper in a tiny tube and mix it with some chemicals that will extract genetic material from their noses and mouths
187, 0 ### even bacteria and some viruses have too
188, 0 ### well several companies around the world are working on making this same technology accessible to everyday people like the pig farmer like you
189, 0 ### truffles are this delicacy that stems from a fungus growing on the roots of living trees
190, 0 ### ian decided to move his lab into sierra leone
191, 0 ### when astronauts live aboard the international space station they're orbiting the planet miles high
196, 1 ### as you see now i'm walking around like crazy
197, 0 ### we all saw the tragedy that happened in boston
198, 1 ### i can tell you for a fact that the next one that they're planning is called the extremely large telescope
199, 0 ### and i was left with this intense feeling of awe and exhilaration at the universe and our own ability to understand as much as we do
200, 1 ### and as you can see it is literally the diagram on the right
201, 1 ### and it allows us to organize the entire dewey decimal system on one continuous run no matter how it grows or contracts within the building it will always have its clarity to end the sort of trail of tears that we've all experienced in public libraries
202, 1 ### this is actually the place that we put into the building so i could propose to my wife right there
204, 1 ### and there is a pedestrian corridor that they wanted to add that would link a series of cultural buildings and a view corridor because this is the historic district that they didn't want to obstruct with a new building
205, 1 ### in fact and you know this this is called the time warner building
206, 0 ### and it concludes in something that you see here that you actually wouldn't expect as being the result of rationality
207, 0 ### i call it sort of shotgun flexibility turn your head this way shoot and you're bound to kill something
208, 0 ### with high modernist flexibility that doesn't really work
209, 0 ### our mandate is media and particularly the book
210, 0 ### and so we proposed what's at the lower diagram
212, 1 ### also the fact that he threatened to sue me because i got a leak of his leaks i thought that showed a remarkable sort of inconsistency in ideology to be honest as well
213, 1 ### i would like us to work towards that
214, 1 ### equally it could be better than we've been led to believe but either way we have to start seeing it exactly as it is with all of its problems because it's only by seeing it with all of its problems that we'll be able to fix them and live in a world in which we can all be happily ever after
215, 0 ### look what they've been hiding from you he said
216, 0 ### and so she set about to make it so
217, 0 ### but it ended up in this very long protracted legal battle and there i was after five years fighting against parliament in front of three of britain's most eminent high court judges waiting for their ruling about whether or not parliament had to release this data
218, 1 ### unfortunately though the site was separated from the river by mclean boulevard so i suggested let's reroute mclean and that gave birth instantly to friends of mclean boulevard
220, 1 ### if you were cheap you could walk on top of a bridge to the roof peek in the exhibits and then get totally seduced come back and pay the five dollars admission
221, 1 ### and as things are a little easier in india the site was purchased within a week and we were working
223, 1 ### but of course the sikhs might give you a job on a platter the jews make it hard international competition phase one phase two phase three
224, 0 ### and out of this idea started spinning off many many kinds of variations of different plans and possibilities and then the plan itself evolved in relationship to the exhibits and you see the intersection of the plan with the geometry
225, 0 ### every piece of the building works
227, 0 ### and then you descend to light and to the north and to life
228, 0 ### we took him on a visit to we took him to the children's memorial he was extremely moved
229, 0 ### and so you know it's one of those things that you don't take too seriously
232, 1 ### there was music playing on this day i think it was madonna's greatest hits
235, 1 ### here's a from the civil war
236, 0 ### and then inserts these long thin instruments and a camera and actually does the procedure inside the patient
237, 0 ### so when i got to graduate school this is what i wanted to work on
239, 0 ### so you're applying a force on a drill towards the wall
240, 1 ### to me that was the golden age
242, 1 ### no pressure
245, 0 ### jobs are being killed off
248, 0 ### when i first met deep blue in in february i had been the world champion for more than years and i had played world championship games and hundreds of games against other top players in other competitions
250, 1 ### you have to choose either option a or option b
252, 1 ### as the parent of a nine girl that number seems awfully low
253, 1 ### it may not be good action but we would take action
254, 0 ### now don't get me wrong i'm not for one minute suggesting that sharing data is a bad thing
255, 0 ### this is an area today that has very few regulations and even fewer rules
256, 1 ### i flip on the light and physically shake the poor boy awake because i know that like ripping off a band aid it's better to get it over with quickly
259, 0 ### only about one in gets the eight to hours of sleep per night recommended by sleep scientists and pediatricians
260, 0 ### these early start policies have a direct effect on how much or really how little sleep american teenagers are getting
262, 1 ### and when i was at stanford i found myself my senior year chemical engineering major half the folks thought i was a political science and performing arts major which was sort of true because i was black student union president and i did major in some other things and i found myself the last quarter juggling chemical engineering separation processes logic classes nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and also producing and choreographing a dance production and i had to do the lighting and the design work and i was trying to figure out do i go to new york city to try to become a professional dancer or do i go to medical school now my mother helped me figure that one out
263, 1 ### but we'll leave that alone
265, 1 ### but we've even had that here on stage so don't act like you don't know what i'm talking about
269, 0 ### to be quite frank i'm concerned
279, 1 ### so if you're thinking about sending your kid to tinkering school they do come back bruised scraped and bloody
280, 1 ### and despite all of our best efforts and intentions kids are always going to figure out how to do the most dangerous thing they can in whatever environment they can
281, 0 ### learning to control one of the most elemental forces in nature is a pivotal moment in any child's personal history
282, 0 ### i first saw this in a canadian film board film when i was and it left a lasting impression to see babies playing with knives
284, 1 ### maybe the banking career puts you on the cutting edge of new forms of financial manipulation
286, 1 ### i am for chocolate donuts
287, 0 ### hard choices seem to be occasions for agonizing hand wringing the gnashing of teeth
288, 0 ### we shouldn't think that all hard choices are big
290, 1 ### ambiguous
291, 0 ### my mum born in england and raised in nigeria currently lives in ghana
327, 1 ### you know what the problem is with you you don't read other people's poetry and you don't got any subordination for verbal measures to tonal consideration
332, 1 ### abrams
333, 1 ### but i found that there were some advantages to being in hollywood
334, 1 ### hollywood has its sex symbols and the valley has its sex symbols
335, 1 ### one of those businesses was a computer rental business called micros on the move which is very well named because people kept stealing the computers
336, 1 ### and with the wisdom of my stanford degree i said pierre what a stupid idea
337, 1 ### the surest way to become a millionaire is to start by being a billionaire and go into the movie business
338, 1 ### we now call al the george clooney of global warming
340, 1 ### and i like this one snow has returned to kilimanjaro
341, 0 ### and what really drives me is a vision of the future that i think we all share
342, 0 ### and i think that's just a horrible thing
343, 0 ### and it struck me that if i could write stories that were about this world as being small and interconnected that maybe i could get people interested in the issues that affected us all and maybe engage them to make a difference
344, 0 ### i went from living in a house with five guys in palo alto and living off their leftovers to all of a sudden having all kinds of resources
345, 0 ### and that really resonated with me
346, 0 ### and she started it about years ago and today she educates over a quarter million african girls
347, 0 ### invest in their organizations or in business
349, 0 ### and much to my surprise they were noticed
351, 1 ### and hamlet
354, 1 ### twenty years later i haven't had a word back from him but i'm still hopeful
355, 1 ### and then when he's finished with ophelia he turns on his mum because basically she has the audacity to fall in love with his uncle and enjoy sex
356, 1 ### when a woman writes about doing it it's an unfortunate genetic disposition
358, 1 ### the current head of the paris said recently it takes great physical strength to conduct a symphony and women are too weak
359, 0 ### i graduated from university to become a theater director and that progress is entirely to do with the fact that people i'll never meet fought for women to have rights get the vote get education have progress
361, 0 ### i think it's a little girl
362, 0 ### but unfortunately the have found out and they're catching up and they've got sirens and they've got their guns they've got the loud it's terribly frightening and they're closing up on the children and the children are never going to make it
363, 0 ### and this is common
364, 0 ### let me talk about hamlet
368, 1 ### millions of americans became activists overnight pouring into the streets in record numbers in record time
369, 1 ### people attend a law lecture a ted talk of the century
370, 1 ### he obviously spends a lot of time on that hair
371, 0 ### now i study even stalk the old masters
372, 0 ### it was almost like the old master was taunting me
373, 0 ### and as we search for the truth about government we should keep work not a lie but an allegory in our collective mind's eye
374, 1 ### but i gathered myself went off in search of a new dream eventually settling on being a scientist perhaps something like the next albert einstein
376, 1 ### we can make a world with monsters with robots that fall in love we can even make pigs fly
377, 1 ### we got so out on making wall e this convincing robot that we made his binoculars practically optically perfect
378, 1 ### he was starting to look glassy eyed
379, 0 ### the idea that all the math science and code i had been learning could come together to create these worlds and characters and stories i connected with was pure magic for me
380, 0 ### but then i got my first taste of lighting
381, 0 ### a major portion of the movie takes place underwater
382, 0 ### as light travels deeper into the water we lose the red wavelengths then the green wavelengths leaving us with blue at the far depths
384, 1 ### because national geographic is a magazine they remind us all the time they publish pictures not excuses
385, 1 ### so we had this little communication breakdown
386, 1 ### oh and they also happen to eat happy feet
387, 1 ### it just sees this big balloon in the ocean it doesn't have hands it's going to take a little bite the boat pops and off they go
388, 1 ### and even in his voice he goes that's a bloody big seal ya
389, 1 ### it's time for you to get in the water
390, 1 ### he said if you get scared you close your eyes ya and she'll go away
391, 1 ### you don't want to be too anthropomorphic but i swear that she looked at me like this useless going to starve in my ocean
392, 1 ### so then she'd get another penguin and try this ballet like sexy display sliding down this iceberg like this
393, 1 ### and then so she realized i couldn't catch live ones so she brought me dead penguins
394, 1 ### because in her world you're either breeding or you're eating and i'm not breeding so
395, 1 ### she chased that big seal away went and got its penguin and brought it to me
396, 0 ### the snow and the ice were my sandbox and the inuit were my teachers
397, 0 ### it's pure white but it's not a polar bear
398, 0 ### please enjoy
400, 0 ### i appreciate it
401, 0 ### and what i'm trying to do with my work is put faces to this
402, 0 ### but this glacier caved into the water and a seal got on it
403, 0 ### when i worked on polar bears as a biologist years ago we never found dead bears
404, 0 ### they're not going to die of hypothermia
405, 0 ### they give birth inside the ice and they feed on the arctic cod that live under the ice
406, 0 ### but what's important in this picture is that you have a piece of multi year ice that big chunk of ice up in the corner
407, 0 ### here's me in my office
408, 1 ### i don't know if you've heard about it newspapers it's a sort of paper based reader
411, 1 ### every village in africa now has a cyber cafe
412, 1 ### it has empowered you it has empowered me and it has empowered some other guys as well
413, 1 ### vietnam
414, 1 ### so by now there must be a hundred pictures of me smiling with my sketches in the files of the vietnamese police
415, 1 ### for those of you old enough to remember we used to have to go to the store to steal it
416, 1 ### this is your life enjoy it
417, 0 ### they were used first by a danish newspaper which wanted to make a point on islam
418, 0 ### you know the story
419, 0 ### i was there to report on that story in cartoons
421, 0 ### we brought together cartoonists from all sides in ivory coast
423, 0 ### in lebanon it was not a book
424, 0 ### and we did video clips you can see them if you go to
425, 0 ### today tech companies are the world's largest editors
426, 1 ### and then i realize the octopus won the arms race because i was out and he had six left
428, 0 ### and this delta water flows to mobile bay and finally into the gulf of mexico
430, 1 ### here i am i'm the second person on the left with the elders in kara a tiny village outside of
432, 0 ### which is why i'll show you a threat and an architectural response
433, 0 ### one billion grains of sand come into existence in the world each second
435, 1 ### when i was growing up in the
439, 0 ### this is like a little payback or something for million people calling me the loser
442, 1 ### and that's not a good experience to leave a gallery like that
443, 1 ### and if she doesn't well that's the story
444, 1 ### the last painting i'm going to talk about is called anonymous by anonymous
445, 0 ### i'm suffering from gallery fatigue
447, 0 ### so it's the first thing i do is i do my own
448, 1 ### so you'd just see her feet
449, 1 ### and i thought these ants are they looking for the queen ant or do they need somewhere to live so i thought perhaps if i made these ants some apartments they'll move in
451, 1 ### and they moved in and decided not to pay me any rent
452, 1 ### as you can see that's a
455, 1 ### and the actual roof is made up of a fiber which i found in my sister's old teddy bear
456, 1 ### and at the same time i have to watch i don't inhale my own work at the same time
460, 1 ### decided to make a paintbrush
461, 0 ### nothing doesn't exist because there is always something
462, 0 ### so i was more or less classed as nothing
463, 0 ### and then she just said you're going back to school tomorrow
464, 0 ### broke the edge of an off
466, 0 ### i think he was just warning him actually
468, 0 ### and the static is interfering with everything
469, 0 ### and i looked at it underneath the microscope
470, 0 ### and the horse is made from nylon
473, 0 ### i built it
474, 1 ### now at this point about nanoseconds in the home plate is far enough away that light hasn't had time to reach it which means the batter still sees the pitcher about to throw and has no idea that anything is wrong
480, 0 ### i started with money
481, 0 ### you can look at how much electricity they need because you need a certain amount of electricity to run the servers and is more efficient than most but they still have some basic requirements and that lets you put a limit on the number of servers that they have
484, 1 ### hedy lamarr said anyone can look glamorous all you have to do is sit there and look stupid
485, 1 ### but there's always this illusion that if you buy this lamp you will live in a world without cords
486, 0 ### not only can he shoot drive drink you know he drinks wine there actually is a little wine in there and of course always wears a tuxedo
487, 0 ### but there is a glamour of industry
488, 1 ### to give me an idea of how many of you here may find what i'm about to tell you of practical value let me ask you please to raise your hands who here is either over years old or hopes to live past age or has parents or grandparents who did live or have lived past raise your hands please
489, 1 ### you are the people to whom my talk will be of practical value
490, 0 ### they constitute experiments from which we ourselves may be able to learn
492, 1 ### and even some internet engineers today say the whole thing is a pilot project and the jury is still out
493, 1 ### i'm pleased to say that thanks to massive government funding about three years ago we finally figured out how bees fly
494, 1 ### it's more like a mosh pit
495, 1 ### i was trying to think of the right model to describe this form of random acts of kindness by geeky strangers
496, 1 ### dumbest idea ever
497, 1 ### and today is so ubiquitous that you can now find it on chinese restaurant menus
499, 1 ### here is my favorite a long story
500, 1 ### right there are crawling it trying to turn every article into an ad for a rolex watch
502, 1 ### com
505, 1 ### it said can you help me get there released it on the streets of manhattan
507, 0 ### these are three of the founders of the internet
508, 0 ### the limitation was that they didn't have any money
509, 0 ### you need a lot of trust but it's not like i'm trying to get to pensacola please
510, 0 ### and before you know it you have a general sense of where everything is
511, 0 ### governments everywhere are often trying to block and filter and censor content on the internet
512, 0 ### and it turns out that as you look at the postmortem of this event you have at one moment perfectly working
516, 0 ### hugely viral video
517, 0 ### they eventually decided not unanimously by any means not to include his real name despite the fact that nearly all media reports did
518, 0 ### we see it on all over the place
519, 0 ### image removed at request of owner
522, 1 ### all the eyes turned to me
523, 1 ### second law is there is a time when panic is the appropriate response
524, 1 ### it's stupid that we put water in plastic bottles in fiji and ship it here
525, 0 ### we've got a climate crisis
526, 0 ### we got on airplanes
527, 0 ### fifty or so of them
528, 1 ### when i met harriet in person the next year at the ted conference she'd gone online and ordered our own happy t shirts
529, 1 ### probably in a few years you'll look in your mirror and it'll be diagnosing you
532, 0 ### but if you think about it if you have a lily pad and it just divided every single day two four eight sixteen in days you'd have
535, 0 ### i don't know if i'd try that but it's available
536, 1 ### by the way they are always hungry
537, 1 ### and they're very happy with that apparently
538, 1 ### and after a few days depending upon temperature the egg will hatch and the larva of this parasite will eat the aphid from the inside
539, 1 ### in your backyard
540, 0 ### and then within plant protection i came into the discipline of biological pest control which we actually define as the use of living organisms to reduce populations of noxious plant pests
543, 0 ### you see the mother in between and two daughters probably on the left and right and a single egg on the right hand side
544, 1 ### the odd one out is an astronomer and i am one of that strange breed
545, 1 ### but the unfinished business for century science is to link together cosmos and micro world with a unified theory symbolized as it were at the top of that picture
546, 1 ### if i was not a self effacing brit i would mention the book myself and i would add that it's available in paperback
547, 1 ### and in america it was called our final hour because americans like instant gratification
549, 0 ### if they'd sent a nuke it would have been rather more spectacular than what actually happened last monday
550, 0 ### it is indeed but the ocean is liquid methane the temperature minus degrees centigrade
551, 0 ### on a still bigger scale we see entire galaxies of stars
552, 0 ### there's scant chance of life there that's because there's been no time for the nuclear fusion in stars to make silicon and carbon and iron the building blocks of planets and of life
558, 1 ### now if you think i'm exaggerating at all in this all you have to do is substitute something else like indonesian
560, 1 ### now swiss works but you know it's going to cost a lot of money
561, 1 ### then i got the words new and old and now i had back to a point where there seemed to be no return
564, 0 ### and this is battista
568, 0 ### whatever
569, 0 ### but then i took the pieces that i had taken off and put them at the bottom
570, 1 ### it's probably part of the project's still in process because this one is actually in front of your eyes
571, 0 ### i brew up to about liters of tea at a time and then while it's still hot add a couple of kilos of sugar
572, 1 ### and i would bring people to the lab and i would put their finger in it and i would crunch it a little bit
575, 1 ### and this is particularly interesting because mit doesn't have an honor code
576, 1 ### but when he actually had a university of pittsburgh sweatshirt cheating went down
577, 0 ### now you must have all taken a band aid off at some point and you must have wondered what's the right approach
579, 0 ### it turns out it would have been better to start with my face which was much more painful and move toward my legs giving me a trend of improvement over time that would have been also less painful
580, 0 ### so my interest in cheating started when enron came on the scene exploded all of a sudden and i started thinking about what is happening here
582, 1 ### i was talking to the oil industry recently and i said they clearly understood that model
589, 0 ### part of the design is designing pieces that are letters long that have to overlap with all the other pieces to build smaller we have to design so they can go together
590, 1 ### and men are much more likely to have their significant other spouse give consent than the other way around
591, 0 ### typically what you're looking at is a fixed brain
592, 1 ### so this guy like was forced to see it every day
593, 0 ### in every work that i create i write messages with my style of a mix of calligraphy and graffiti
595, 1 ### three days later it faded and a week later no more complaining anywhere
596, 0 ### you can't help but actually ripping that spider web apart
598, 1 ### it was an agent's wet dream
599, 1 ### so with emotions running high and absolutely no experience in butchery some friends and i opened a meat store in the heart of the east village fashion district
601, 0 ### there were even these two athletes who took a sabbatical from the league to do so
603, 0 ### they demand us to find uncompromising ways to be acknowledged and respected
604, 1 ### he wants to get your cookies
605, 1 ### when it asked people to rate it on terms of the quality of the working alliance people rated the robot higher and they trusted the robot more
606, 1 ### they would dress the robots
607, 0 ### and i remember thinking about all the reasons why that was the case
608, 0 ### this is a watch that my girlfriend gave me
609, 0 ### and one of my favorite robots is leonardo
610, 1 ### i was thinking that the sun is kind of the ultimate alchemist
611, 1 ### and then this is like projects that are harder to build
612, 0 ### the bronze is nice hard durable material that could roll on the ground
613, 0 ### and then there was a second level to this object which is that it i wanted it to convey some proportions that i was interested in which is the diameter of the moon and the diameter of the earth in proportion to each other
615, 1 ### reporters call this making shit up
616, 1 ### see how he developed a vocal game together with my wife only from the desire and pure joy of being coupled to another human being
617, 0 ### now we have to ask how these patterns in my brain that are associated with my memories and ideas are transmitted into your brains
618, 0 ### and as you can see in this particular brain area the responses are going up and down as the story is unfolding
620, 1 ### boy
622, 1 ### gender identity is who you go to bed as
624, 1 ### and she was offered contracts as a model at which point she teased me when she said you know i might have had a better chance as a model if you'd made me six feet one
625, 0 ### but there is nothing that is definable at the time of birth that would define you
627, 0 ### this wasn't rocket science
628, 0 ### sometimes their parents would reject them siblings their own children and then their divorcing spouse would forbid them from seeing their children
630, 1 ### now in fairness if you've spent any time at all in washington you know this is really a radical concept for the government
633, 0 ### that's why i began investigating the most secretive and experimental prison units in the united states for so called second tier terrorists
636, 1 ### i got up the next morning went to the computer and looked at the results and was hoping for something that walked in a straight line like i've just demonstrated and this is what i got instead
637, 1 ### so this is the one that can't walk at all
638, 1 ### now after five generations of applying evolutionary process the genetic algorithm is getting a tiny bit better
639, 1 ### and again if you move the obstacle a tiny bit it'll again fall differently
640, 1 ### we just did that for a laugh just to see what happens
642, 1 ### that's what we're giving them
643, 1 ### you feel kind of sorry for that thing and we've seen it so many times now that we don't really care any more
644, 1 ### and i think there you go
645, 0 ### we already saw that briefly yesterday
646, 0 ### the reason for that is that these characters are actually not real characters
647, 0 ### there's no real emergence there
648, 0 ### it's not something you get in computer games at the moment at all
649, 0 ### that stick figure is physically stimulated
650, 0 ### so we simulated that as well and then the really tricky bit is to teach that network how to walk
651, 0 ### now at this stage we decided to start a company and move this further because obviously this was just a very simple
653, 0 ### but what it will do i'm going to push it again
656, 1 ### and since this came in on a friday they were able to get this great footage of this thing breaking up as it came in over west virginia maryland pennsylvania and new jersey until it did that to a car in new york
657, 1 ### now in over siberia near the region for those of you who are dan aykroyd fans and saw ghostbusters when he talked about the greatest cross dimensional rift since the siberia blast of where he got the date wrong but that's ok
660, 1 ### if you've heard about the mayan apocalypse you're going to hear about because you're keyed in to all the doomsday networks anyway
664, 1 ### i think even nasa can do that and proved that they can
665, 1 ### and this is the part it's the part i just love
666, 1 ### bam we're gonna hit this thing in the face then we bring in the velvet gloves
667, 0 ### ok now a six rock is very large
668, 0 ### everest
670, 0 ### but it won't wipe out you know all life on earth so that's fine
671, 0 ### the one over was probably made of rock and that's much more so it blew up in the air
672, 0 ### but it's still something to be aware of
673, 0 ### these are just stars
674, 0 ### we're building telescopes that are looking for the threat
675, 0 ### in fact is a blessing in disguise because it woke us up to the dangers of these things
680, 1 ### so i come with my and i spray them on the suit on the tank and on the whole wall and this is how it stands today until further notice
681, 0 ### on everything ever produced under islamic or arab patronage in the past years from spain to the borders of china
682, 1 ### don't do this at home
683, 1 ### why do they hold the key the answer quite simply is they have the money
685, 1 ### i like it too
686, 0 ### let me remind you what we already know
687, 0 ### social includes human capital things like employee engagement and innovation capacity as well as supply chain management and labor rights and human rights
688, 0 ### they started to see sustainability not just as important but crucial to business success
692, 1 ### when they wanted a telephone in our house they needed to order it and then wait wait for nearly five years before it got installed in our house
693, 0 ### but my husband jon and i spend a lot of time thinking and creating visions of different futures in our studio
697, 1 ### i've worked with one of those
699, 1 ### his union jack underpants were made in india
700, 1 ### and they're laundered regularly by a very nice polish lady
701, 0 ### and it's about identities we just assume that we have without thinking too much about them
704, 0 ### i was brought up in the near wembley with asian english caribbean irish families living in our street and the neo nazi national front was massive then with regular marches and attacks on us and a permanent threat and often a frequent reality of violence against us on the streets in our homes typically by neo nazis and other racists
705, 0 ### everyone knew everyone else's business even if they didn't want it to be known by anyone at all
706, 1 ### you with me so i just need to hook you up
708, 1 ### okay do it again a little bit
709, 1 ### so hit it again
711, 0 ### and there are zero cures for these diseases
712, 0 ### so right before what is your name sam kelly sam
715, 0 ### so keep doing it really hard
717, 1 ### the picture i'm about to show you is a compelling picture
718, 1 ### this is a good time to look at your feet check your blackberry do anything other than look at the screen
719, 1 ### they've decided that liposuction fluid which in the united states we have a lot of liposuction fluid
720, 1 ### in the united states we've had a somewhat different approach
721, 0 ### and we're going to do all of that in minutes i promise
722, 0 ### we know that if we have a damaged hip you can put an artificial hip in
723, 0 ### very few good ideas if you agree that this is a good idea very few good ideas are truly novel
724, 0 ### many of the talks yesterday talked about improving the quality of life and reducing poverty and essentially increasing life expectancy all around the globe
726, 1 ### now here you'll find that even jesus has competition
727, 0 ### this is endemic to mauritius and its particular feature is its
728, 1 ### and if you have lived an extraordinary life you will be welcomed to elysium or what the french call champs the heaven of the heroes
729, 1 ### groundhog day
730, 1 ### but if you look at cultures which have cyclical and based on infinite lives you will see a comfort with fuzzy logic with opinion with thinking with everything is relative sort of mostly
732, 1 ### it's about setting getting the job done by bending or breaking the rules just look at your indian people around here you'll see them smile they know what it is
733, 1 ### and mythology does not pay well until now
735, 1 ### just know where i came from why i did the
737, 0 ### how come said
739, 0 ### tells us why the sun rises why we were born
740, 0 ### yours is faith
741, 0 ### indus
745, 0 ### and he wanted to hoist his flag to say i was here first
746, 1 ### by that point i basically had a master's degree in escape attempts
747, 0 ### and when i entered into colombian politics i thought i'd be able to withstand any temperature
748, 1 ### i will also tell you we're at least as buggy
750, 1 ### we could conceivably expand the climate window we could make pinot noir grow maybe in long island god forbid
755, 0 ### so i will tell you right off of the bat
757, 0 ### is a very elegant molecule
760, 1 ### we finally after years of knowing that was a healthier option we're finally getting to the point where we actually are tipping over and attempting to actually eat them
763, 0 ### and ultimately the challenge of the baker the challenge of every culinary student of every chef is to deliver flavor
764, 1 ### and one of the english said you know what another half an hour and we would have won
766, 1 ### take a look you could play it in the dump with some rocks over there you could play it in a little alley you couldn't hit square anywhere because the bat hit the wall don't forget the air conditioning and the cable wires
768, 1 ### thank god for them
769, 1 ### the accident of course there was that the thought the bowler was bowling fast
770, 1 ### and thankfully for all of us the english are very good at inventing things and then the gracious people that they are they let the world become very good at it
771, 1 ### it was not like reengineering that we do in medicine we just took it straight away as is
772, 1 ### everyone secretly watched them but everyone claimed not to
773, 1 ### of course a lot of people said maybe they dance better than they play
774, 1 ### so he played in hyderabad went straight after the game went from the stadium to hyderabad airport sat in a private corporate jet first refueling in portugal second refueling in brazil he was in west indies in time
777, 0 ### and we won this world cup in
778, 0 ### we cut customs duties we reduced import duties and we got all the multinationals coming in with multinational budgets who looked at per capita income and got very excited about the possibilities in india and were looking for a vehicle to reach every indian
779, 0 ### for a long time television said we won't cover cricket unless you pay us to cover it
781, 0 ### the other was indian cricket
782, 0 ### it was never promoted it was never sold it was organized
784, 0 ### and all of a sudden indian sport had awakened to the reality that you can source the best product for the best price anywhere in the world
785, 0 ### there is cricket and the movies
789, 0 ### in fact the planets and moons you see here could host life all of them and we know that and it's a strong possibility
791, 1 ### i her
792, 0 ### now in this discussion today i'm going to focus on a different aspect of
796, 1 ### but after coming back to japan totally nothing changed in my life
798, 0 ### so i quit my company and started a career as a professional performer
800, 1 ### this is south los angeles
802, 1 ### plus you get strawberries
803, 1 ### if kids grow kale kids eat kale
804, 1 ### the funny thing about sustainability you have to sustain it
806, 0 ### so what i did i planted a food forest in front of my house
807, 0 ### and this is how i decided to maintain it
808, 0 ### my councilman even called in and said how they endorse and love what we're doing
810, 1 ### we were walking with him holding onto my shoulder i miscalculated how much space there was between us and i knocked him into a gate
811, 1 ### and to this day he says that i was the coach who left the most important mark on his career
812, 1 ### when i looked up two guys were seated three were lying down and others were squatting
813, 1 ### i was slightly afraid to ask what type of miracles he meant and he replied nonchalantly coach let me take the team to the church and when we return i guarantee that half of them will be able to see
814, 1 ### besides let me make this clear if we go to that church and i end up being able to see when we return i will beat you so hard if i can't play tomorrow
815, 1 ### fortunately there were no gates along the way
816, 0 ### the blind who attended the institute would play their games there just like i did at a field near my house
817, 0 ### i put it on and tried to play
818, 0 ### so we started looking for volunteers to help us run with them
819, 0 ### we would have to train differently
820, 0 ### in fact they would let us use the field only when no other teams were using it
821, 0 ### we were growing as a team
822, 1 ### i'll never do it again
823, 1 ### in the third condition the experimenter got the sheet of paper and put it directly into a shredder
824, 1 ### and ikea is a store with kind of okay furniture that takes a long time to assemble
825, 1 ### but when i finish it i seem to like those ikea pieces of furniture more than i like other ones
827, 1 ### now everything was fine
829, 1 ### why because now the builders loved it even more
830, 1 ### because in reality it was even uglier than the first version
831, 1 ### most people would say for a lot a lot of money
833, 1 ### they were just like your kids and you played with them for a few hours and when you were about to leave the parents said hey by the way just before you leave if you're interested they're for sale
834, 1 ### by the way if you think ikea instructions are not good what about the instructions that come with kids those are really tough
835, 0 ### it suggests that there's all kinds of other things that motivate us to work or behave in all kinds of ways
836, 0 ### and the day before it was due he sent his presentation to his boss and his boss wrote him back and said nice presentation but the merger is canceled
838, 0 ### this was what we called the meaningful condition
839, 0 ### and if you remember the story about was punished by the gods to push the same rock up a hill and when he almost got to the end the rock would roll over and he would have to start again
842, 0 ### now we had another version of this experiment
843, 0 ### and you would speculate that the people who love would build more even for less money because after all they get more internal joy from it
844, 0 ### soon after i finished running this experiment i went to talk to a big software company in seattle
846, 0 ### they said the could have asked them to present to the whole company about their journey over the last two years and what they decided to do
847, 0 ### but if you understood how important meaning is then you would figure out that it's actually important to spend some time energy and effort in getting people to care more about what they're doing
848, 1 ### okay
851, 1 ### now then
852, 0 ### and great insight really was to think here's a child who can't see
853, 0 ### but out of all the bashing after a few months emerged the most fantastic music and i think there was just a miracle moment really derek when you realized that all the sounds you hear in the world out there is something that you can copy on the keyboard
856, 1 ### something that in many ways i wish no one would ever know but here i feel kind of obliged to reveal
857, 1 ### the late in a moment of youthful indiscretion i went to law school
858, 1 ### i in fact graduated in the part of my law school class that made the top possible
859, 1 ### i never practiced law a day in my life i pretty much wasn't allowed to
862, 1 ### i'm an american i don't believe in philosophy
863, 1 ### this is a fact or as we say in my hometown of washington d
864, 1 ### training ground for great economic thinkers like george soros and friedrich hayek and mick jagger
866, 1 ### it's a huge trademark violation but it's pretty clever
867, 0 ### this is called the candle problem
869, 0 ### doesn't work
870, 0 ### he gathered his participants and said i'm going to time you how quickly you can solve this problem
872, 0 ### but that's not happening here
873, 0 ### this is one of the most robust findings in social science and also one of the most ignored
874, 0 ### let me show you
875, 0 ### you want to be looking around
876, 0 ### so what really matters are the more right brained creative conceptual kinds of abilities
877, 0 ### everybody in this room is dealing with their own version of the candle problem
878, 1 ### so remember these are primitive things so dancing that's very interesting to us
879, 1 ### right
880, 1 ### these are very dirty little as a matter of fact
881, 0 ### it's very simplistic
882, 0 ### now this is necessary to distinguish the self from the environment
885, 1 ### my career would probably last about five years
886, 1 ### now my career may last a little longer
888, 1 ### snow
889, 1 ### well then stop clapping
890, 1 ### rain
891, 1 ### and of course i returned with all sorts of bruises
892, 0 ### because you know when you look at a piece of music for example if i just open my little motorbike bag we have here hopefully a piece of music that is full of little black dots on the page
893, 0 ### i'm being told where to play on the drum
894, 0 ### in the same way i look at the music i get a basic idea i wonder what technically might be hard or you know what i want to do
895, 0 ### and you feel really quite believe it or not detached from the instrument and from the stick even though i'm actually holding the stick quite tightly
896, 0 ### so in the same way that i need time with this instrument i need time with people in order to interpret them
899, 0 ### same amount of weight but different sound colors
900, 1 ### which leads us to a question what was he thinking when he was being measured perhaps something very naughty
901, 1 ### what a company
903, 0 ### compassion is something that creates happiness
908, 1 ### this is the kind of sequence that i love looking at day and night
909, 1 ### that's just the best
911, 0 ### on the bottom here this is the geologic and the numbers on it indicate millions of years from the present so the zero here that would be today
913, 0 ### inside each spider there are hundreds of silk glands sometimes thousands
914, 1 ### it's totally appropriate for a four
915, 1 ### so we took a room downstairs in the basement that had been used as sort of an abu annex
917, 0 ### whatever
919, 0 ### there's a whole gray market for lego thousands of home based businesses
920, 1 ### so this thing right here is freaking me out
921, 1 ### so i just figured that out earlier
922, 1 ### by this point i was definitely not going to be an employee
923, 1 ### and say these are good ones
924, 1 ### if you go into a restaurant and have bad customer service show them what bad customer service looks like
927, 0 ### when i was in grade two i won a citywide speaking competition but nobody had ever said hey this kid's a good speaker
928, 0 ### entrepreneurs are people we have a lot of them in this room who have ideas and passions or see these needs in the world and decide to stand up and do it
929, 0 ### teach a man to fish you feed him for a lifetime
931, 0 ### both my grandfathers and my dad were entrepreneurs
933, 1 ### and we're a non profit foundation you can give us the property and take a hell of a tax deduction
934, 1 ### we want a temporary use permit for the clock eventually temporary use permit
936, 1 ### in fact danny hillis can estimate altitude by how much math he can't do in his head
937, 1 ### how about crevice no
938, 0 ### it would be helpful if humanity got into the habit of thinking of the now not just as next week or next quarter but you know next years and the last years basically story so far
939, 0 ### it's the first working prototype of the clock
941, 0 ### that's what happens to buildings
943, 0 ### we looked at in new mexico
944, 1 ### to be new at ted it's like being the last high school virgin
946, 1 ### oh stop clapping
948, 1 ### and then they hopped in it turned the little electronic key rather than the real key zipped home on their new superhighway and drove straight into a garage that looks like a tudor castle
950, 0 ### but i really appreciate being here
953, 0 ### they've chosen a project by daniel the enfant terrible of the moment of architecture
954, 0 ### but that's what we're going to do
956, 1 ### i'm just pro arithmetic
958, 1 ### so if you were in palm springs
959, 0 ### for
960, 0 ### whoa
962, 1 ### we had one government agency and one company aircraft operator say you're crazy don't do that you're going kill the guy
963, 1 ### so we did a second parabola
964, 1 ### and we did a fourth and a fifth and a sixth
965, 0 ### we have something called the genome individuals we're sequencing as part of that
966, 0 ### and what he said for me was very moving
967, 0 ### we set up a whole er
968, 1 ### and among those was liking a page for curly fries
970, 1 ### the secret to productivity in so many fields and in is letting dead people do your work for you
971, 1 ### we take an idea combine it with a square and you get an figure
972, 1 ### and it's so simple
973, 1 ### it runs on all the major platforms even windows
974, 1 ### well then you could do an organ
975, 0 ### what is most people think they know what is
976, 0 ### this is a plate from
977, 0 ### but even more importantly he created a language a way we could communicate a code of dots dashes and arrows
978, 0 ### they have to obey four simple laws
979, 0 ### if you look at the angles around the fold you find that if you number the angles in a circle all the even numbered angles add up to a straight line all the odd numbered angles add up to a straight line
985, 1 ### i would add nobody gets out alive
986, 1 ### one is icing and simmering which are great stalling tactics that offer a kind of holding pattern that emphasizes the undefined nature of a relationship but at the same time gives you enough of a comforting consistency and enough freedom of the undefined boundaries
987, 1 ### and is basically you disappear from this massa of texts on the spot and you don't have to deal with the pain that you inflict on another because you're making it invisible even to yourself
989, 1 ### we went from a production economy to a service economy
991, 0 ### i study the brain
993, 0 ### fourteen million or more people have now taken the questionnaire and i've been able to watch who's naturally drawn to whom
996, 0 ### americans think that this is reckless
998, 0 ### the double income family was the rule
1000, 1 ### and it would get exhausted and it would collapse every time
1001, 0 ### and as i grew up it became worse and worse and i started to think of it as a form of control
1002, 1 ### i thought every seven went through this
1003, 0 ### it's a stretch of beach we know so well
1004, 1 ### all right there's this episode of star trek
1005, 0 ### but then we listen to the other percent of our stuff recorded
1008, 1 ### but hey at least it's
1009, 1 ### and he said oh yeah i remember that too i remember my image of you was that you were up on the shore yelling at me
1010, 1 ### and nick ended up with a lot of pictures of the rear ends of baboons
1011, 1 ### this is sort of the munch of the penguins
1012, 1 ### this mouthing behavior on the right was really her way of saying to him hey look how big i am or you know my what big teeth you have
1013, 1 ### and she did this over the course of a couple of days until the point where she got so frustrated with him that she started putting them directly on top of his head
1015, 0 ### he mounted a camera on the tail
1016, 0 ### shot straight down so these are the shadows of the camels
1017, 0 ### but i turned away for a moment and he got caught into a and started to be pulled out towards the jetty
1018, 0 ### we got back on shore he was fine
1019, 0 ### and seeing this reinforces for me that every one of us has at least one or two great photographs in them
1020, 0 ### the original intent was to travel there and bring back a classic story of diverse species of an exotic locale
1021, 0 ### it was with the elephants that this story pivoted
1022, 1 ### it's a self portrait titled wide hips
1024, 0 ### in fact after college i applied to seven art schools and was rejected by all seven
1025, 0 ### thousands of people saw it and one of them was the manual sola morales who was redesigning the waterfront in porto portugal
1026, 1 ### probably one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero
1028, 1 ### i'm told they don't bite in fact they might not even leave that jar
1030, 0 ### so the climate changes will be terrible for them
1033, 0 ### it's an average of about five tons for everyone on the planet
1034, 1 ### and i particularly remember a really good speech by kim jong il on how to get teens smoking again
1035, 1 ### what you should in fact do is employ all of the world's top male and female supermodels pay them to walk the length of the train handing out free chateau petrus for the entire duration of the journey
1036, 1 ### they have no side effects or if they do they're imaginary so you can safely ignore them
1038, 1 ### and also century ate very very few vegetables rather like contemporary scottish people
1039, 1 ### and he planted it in a royal potato patch with guards who had instructions to guard over it night and day but with secret instructions not to guard it very well
1041, 1 ### there is your environmental problem solved by the way guys all convicted child molesters have to drive a porsche cayenne
1042, 1 ### so the modern equivalent would of course be this
1043, 1 ### on the left you have rupert murdoch or the bbc
1044, 0 ### this is a train which goes from london to paris
1045, 0 ### very clever buenos aires street vendors decided to practice price discrimination to the detriment of any passing gringo tourists
1046, 0 ### tiny little behavioral economics detail in italy penalty points go backwards
1047, 0 ### the wealthy to help in the war against the french were encouraged to give in all their jewelry
1048, 0 ### coca cola
1049, 0 ### it involves limited raw materials
1050, 0 ### if you had a large red button of this kind on the wall of your home and every time you pressed it it saved dollars for you put dollars into your pension you would save a lot more
1051, 0 ### like a six if you flip it over it looks like a nine
1052, 0 ### one of them is poetry is when you make new things familiar and familiar things new
1054, 1 ### that was his idea of a performance enhancing drug
1055, 1 ### today one in men in the is at least seven feet tall but a seven man is incredibly rare in the general population so rare that if you know an american man between the ages of and who is at least seven feet tall there's a percent chance he's in the right now
1056, 1 ### thirty two men did that last october
1057, 1 ### here's running up the
1058, 0 ### now we all have this feeling that we're somehow just getting better as a human race inexorably progressing but it's not like we've evolved into a new species in a century
1059, 0 ### now picture the stadium last year at the world championships of the meters thousands of fans waiting with baited breath to see bolt the fastest man in history popping as the nine fastest men in the world coil themselves into their blocks
1060, 0 ### bolt passes him and as the runners come to the finish you'll hear a beep as each man crosses the line
1062, 1 ### so i just copied and pasted from my
1063, 1 ### i talked a lot about
1064, 1 ### and they say to me stop complaining
1065, 1 ### i'm going to shove it into my bag i'm going to have this email template and i'm going to fill it out and collect information on all these different data points during the date to prove to everybody that empirically these dates really are terrible
1066, 1 ### so i started tracking things like really stupid awkward sexual remarks bad vocabulary the number of times a man forced me to high five him
1067, 1 ### so as it turns out for some reason men who drink scotch reference kinky sex immediately
1068, 1 ### i also wanted somebody who would weigh pounds more than me at all times regardless of what i weighed
1069, 1 ### these things were also important to me but not necessarily deal breakers
1071, 1 ### they all looked really great which turned out to be in sharp contrast to what i had
1072, 1 ### i was the most popular person online
1074, 1 ### they should be fluffy not hard
1075, 0 ### you've got to date around
1076, 0 ### so that wasn't going to work
1077, 0 ### i figure about half of that are men so that takes the number down to
1078, 0 ### so i have two possible strategies at this point i'm sort of figuring out
1080, 0 ### the algorithm matched us up because we share a love of gadgets we share a love of math and data and music and so i agreed to go out with him
1081, 0 ### guy and i are really just not meant for each other but we'll part ways as friends when he gets up to go to the bathroom and in the meantime the bill comes to our table
1082, 0 ### very few of us have the ability to be totally and brutally honest with ourselves
1083, 0 ### so i said fine i've got a new plan
1085, 0 ### and i guess the one variable that i haven't considered is the competition
1086, 0 ### when i released these men into the wild i did follow some rules
1087, 0 ### well one month later i had a lot of data and i was able to do another analysis
1088, 1 ### and there i am
1090, 1 ### as i try to get deeper this is slapping on a one person submarine suit some people call this my jacques cousteau meets woody allen moment
1091, 0 ### but we're humans we're terrestrial mammals
1093, 0 ### as we go down underwater after about meters all the red is gone
1094, 1 ### what'll happen is that the styrofoam peanuts will start moving through our society here and they will accumulate in the people
1095, 0 ### we know that right we've experienced that
1096, 1 ### and she's looking as young as ever
1099, 1 ### new york literary figures dorothy parker robert benchley and robert sherwood all writers in the algonquin round table decided to stand up for transparency and showed up for work the next day with their salary written on signs hanging from their neck
1100, 0 ### most of us are uncomfortable with the idea of broadcasting our salary
1102, 1 ### i learned a lot about how to deal with that part of the world
1103, 1 ### now i don't know how many of you have ever done that with your kids but if you do please trust me it's the most pressure you can put on a child to say we trust you that you will always do the right thing
1104, 0 ### and i think you will see why the two greatest passions in my life today are children and education
1105, 0 ### and somehow to this day i frankly don't know how he was so aware of what was going on in the world but by inviting me to sit down with him when i was only a few years old and playing records in this by mozart and he would tell me how mozart was the most romantic of all the classic composers ever and how claire de which was one of his favorites was a real exposure to me to classical music
1106, 1 ### in spite of my man hat crocheted from plastic shopping bags they shook my hand
1107, 0 ### only we humans make waste that nature can't digest
1108, 1 ### six i can do that
1109, 1 ### thank you very much so so usually i am creating a design that is in some way based on the text but this is all the text there is
1113, 1 ### this is a self portrait
1115, 1 ### but i think what we can all agree on is that actual photographs of human mouths at least based on this are off putting
1116, 1 ### i am still waiting for a call from the
1117, 1 ### they just didn't even bother to make the and the green those idiots
1118, 0 ### it wasn't clear
1119, 0 ### now how many people know what this is okay
1120, 0 ### clarity gets to the point
1121, 0 ### here's an example of a design that i've done recently for a novel by murakami who i've done design work for for over years now and this is a novel about a young man who has four dear friends who all of a sudden after their freshman year of college completely cut him off with no explanation and he is devastated
1123, 0 ### this led me to graffiti
1124, 0 ### and then pearl harbor happens and as if his life wasn't difficult enough now the race relations have really ratcheted up and then the japanese american internment camps are quickly created and there's lots of tension and horrible stuff as he's still trying to solve this murder
1130, 1 ### yes
1131, 0 ### today we have the third largest film industry in the world
1132, 1 ### the way to read this slide is to look at your age on the horizontal axis
1134, 0 ### and what we're learning is going to shed some light on what the romantic writers and poets described as the celestial openness of the child's mind
1140, 1 ### and while these are both wonderful things in their own right they both have very wonderful things going for them truth and beauty as ideals that can be looked at by the sciences and by math are almost like the ideal conjoined twins that a scientist would want to date
1141, 1 ### in fact it would really in the absence of these machines have made the attendance here chris really quite sparse
1142, 1 ### so no matter how lazy you feel you're not really intrinsically doing nothing
1143, 0 ### truth and beauty are things that are often opaque to people who are not in the sciences
1144, 0 ### so we have an opportunity to really open up education
1145, 0 ### and these micro machines power how a cell moves
1146, 1 ### i was there to solve world hunger
1147, 1 ### so i strode into the headquarters building and my eyes scanned the row of un flags and i smiled as i thought to myself the engineer is here
1149, 1 ### you're welcome
1150, 1 ### it's the right idea but at the wrong time and the right idea at the wrong time is the wrong idea
1151, 1 ### it finally is the right idea at the right time
1152, 0 ### it's inspiring
1154, 0 ### that's already over different combinations
1155, 0 ### it turned out to be incredibly successful
1156, 0 ### they brought in companies
1157, 0 ### i've been in the private sector for two years now
1159, 1 ### another time i was devastated because my favorite mobile game bird was being taken off the app store
1160, 1 ### so i was faced with the dilemma to either never update my phone or never play bird again
1161, 1 ### i made a physical version of bird that could never be taken off the app store
1163, 0 ### after all we all played with those since we were kids and they are also pretty cheap and can be found anywhere around the house
1164, 0 ### i noticed a lot of people from very diverse backgrounds started coming to our workshops
1165, 0 ### perhaps one solution could be to introduce technology to students through creative projects
1166, 1 ### back in the and when i was growing up little girls were supposed to be kind and thoughtful and pretty and gentle and soft and we were supposed to fit into roles that were sort of shadowy really not quite clear what we were supposed to be
1167, 1 ### we're told what shape we're supposed to be in
1168, 1 ### and on top of all off these rules they keep changing
1169, 0 ### and i just ate it up
1170, 0 ### we have amazing antennae
1171, 0 ### and i think i truly believe that we can change this thing one laugh at a time
1172, 1 ### but we had a philosophy which is it only has to look good for a thousandth of a second
1173, 1 ### so we have two halves of one of the best kitchens in the world
1174, 0 ### and it's largely what you would find in these books
1175, 0 ### there's a chef in spain named ferran adria
1176, 1 ### thank you
1177, 1 ### so let's switch back to that
1178, 0 ### and they actually use the nintendo remote
1179, 0 ### so i'm going to show you how to create one with a remote
1180, 1 ### members of the african national congress thought that in the bush he would have time to rest and recuperate away from the public eye and it's true that lions tend to be a very good deterrent to press and paparazzi
1181, 1 ### without you i'm just a guy talking to an empty room and i spent a lot of time last week doing that and it's not the same as this
1182, 1 ### the only accusation i ever heard leveled at him was when one of our clients said solly you are pathologically helpful
1183, 1 ### welcome i love you
1184, 1 ### don't go in there
1185, 1 ### it's a very strange sensation having another creature try and eat you and there are few things that promote vegetarianism like that
1186, 1 ### but i just think of so many occurrences like the time he went on the oprah show and asked her what the show would be about
1187, 1 ### i mean that's just incredible humility
1188, 0 ### i grew up in the wild eastern part of south africa at a place called game reserve
1189, 0 ### i am because of you
1190, 0 ### the first job that he ever got in the safari business was fixing the safari trucks
1191, 0 ### as it bites the second time i kick
1192, 0 ### i make an instant decision that i'll never look at that again
1193, 0 ### i'm still in a vulnerable position
1194, 0 ### he wraps it around my leg picks me up a second time walks me to a vehicle and he's able to get me to medical attention
1195, 0 ### pain is shared
1197, 1 ### it's just boring letters and she was right
1199, 0 ### and i did
1200, 1 ### we're not the only ones
1204, 1 ### no you're not
1206, 0 ### we start with poverty
1208, 0 ### but they kept at it and i now understand why they did what they did
1210, 1 ### and i was scared
1213, 0 ### don't just tell me that you study but tell me that you study which is the mesh like structure of our bones because it's important to understanding and treating osteoporosis
1214, 1 ### they don't have any shoes yet
1215, 1 ### actually it's not really an experiment because i know the outcome
1217, 1 ### at that point they usually give up
1218, 1 ### you can see it by looking at my head
1219, 1 ### i don't know how we got into this position
1220, 1 ### i went back and i transformed my entire company into a one buttock company
1221, 1 ### the people who don't mind classical music
1222, 1 ### you might hear it like second hand smoke at the airport
1223, 1 ### actually i hear a lot my husband is tone deaf
1224, 1 ### of course i'm not sure they'll be up to it
1225, 0 ### i was working with this young pianist and said the trouble with you is you're a two buttock player
1226, 0 ### the telephone
1227, 0 ### the tone deaf people they're no longer here
1229, 0 ### this is about vision
1233, 0 ### it's about how many shining eyes i have around me
1235, 0 ### now can we do that no
1238, 1 ### to get rid of an odd habit he had of involuntarily lifting his shoulder he practiced his speeches in front of a mirror and he suspended a sword from the ceiling so that if he raised his shoulder it would hurt
1239, 1 ### when i needed a knee surgery i didn't tell the surgeon poke around in there and focus on what you don't know
1240, 0 ### so i'd like to share with you some insights into why that is and what we can all do about it
1241, 0 ### both of these zones should be part of our lives but being clear about when we want to be in each of them with what goal focus and expectations helps us better perform and better improve
1243, 1 ### and i could list more
1246, 0 ### happy novelties
1247, 0 ### that's silly
1248, 1 ### the first follower is what transforms a lone nut into a leader
1249, 0 ### if you really care about starting a movement have the courage to follow and show others how to follow
1250, 1 ### juggling three balls is simple and normal
1255, 1 ### what you're going to learn is this
1256, 1 ### finger finger finger finger finger finger finger finger
1257, 1 ### a lot of different learning processes going on in here
1260, 1 ### but i want you to do is also with your eyes is follow the colored ball that i ask you to follow
1263, 1 ### cheating
1264, 1 ### to listen
1265, 1 ### now i'm going to show you the beginnings of a piece that is about balance in some ways and also oh actually if you're bored not here here's one use for it
1266, 0 ### well i learned a lot about interesting things that i knew nothing about at the time but grew to know stuff about
1267, 0 ### part of the challenge was to try to understand rhythm and space using not just my hands because a lot of juggling is hand oriented but using the rhythm of my body and feet and controlling the balls with my feet
1268, 0 ### so juggling gravity up down
1269, 0 ### ok then you've got to combine them because then you have the whole spatial palette in front of you
1270, 0 ### it goes
1273, 0 ### all right
1277, 0 ### and it has to settle
1278, 0 ### which leads me to the next thing which is what have i got here ok
1279, 0 ### it's a combination of that the beauty of that the shape and the stories that were involved in it as well as the fact that they protected the contents
1281, 0 ### and then changing levels
1283, 1 ### don't give any more information
1284, 1 ### and she said and where do um where do human women like where do women lay their eggs and i said well funny you should ask
1285, 1 ### i know
1286, 1 ### it is a little bit like having a waste treatment plant right next to an amusement park
1289, 0 ### humans are so private
1297, 0 ### we normally have these very long lead in times
1298, 1 ### and this is a rare action shot ladies and gentlemen
1300, 1 ### well as i'm trying to figure out what two story window i'm going to jump out of and change things up i read some altogether different advice from warren buffett and he said taking jobs to build up your resume is the same as saving up sex for old age
1301, 1 ### turns out the pep talk totally worked and i felt this total feeling of calm and i think it was because jonathan was years old
1302, 0 ### and i'd just come back from living in spain for a while and i'd joined this fortune company
1303, 0 ### and i found pretty quickly that i wasn't alone it turns out that over percent of the people around don't enjoy their work
1304, 1 ### so when i was a child i don't know how many of you grew up in the but i was sent upstairs for an enforced rest
1305, 1 ### it isn't some cultic thing
1309, 0 ### so imagine we're in the middle of america
1311, 0 ### you can see i don't do much
1312, 1 ### and this is a guy from salt lake city this is what they look like out there
1313, 0 ### from urban planning and master planning to theater and all sorts of stuff
1314, 1 ### and that is quite simply to have nothing to remember
1317, 0 ### our research often starts with a very simple question
1318, 1 ### within seconds as if the panels have noticed the presence of the viewer they appear to panic and sort of get into a strict symmetry
1319, 1 ### and after a while if the viewer continues to remain in the space the panels will sort of become immune to the presence of the viewer and become lax and autonomous again until they sort of sense a presence in the room or a movement when they will again snap to attention
1320, 1 ### but the idea is that once it's got the person's attention it's no longer interested and it looks for the next person whose attention to get
1321, 1 ### so imagine our excitement when we saw it really working in the studio and here it is
1322, 0 ### so i'm just going to take you to a video
1323, 0 ### one is through a still camera and the other is through a handheld camera
1324, 0 ### that sort of likens it to the amount of strain to be at the service of the observer and present this piece of paper very delicately to the viewer in front of them
1325, 0 ### so from where i'm standing each of you appears to be this big and the audience sort of takes the entire field of my vision
1326, 1 ### as you might guess this was not a very popular strategy with the villagers
1327, 1 ### now i'm guessing that this sounds terrifying
1328, 1 ### partly because they believe that scientists will be very cautious and responsible about using them
1329, 0 ### that was pretty much just for convenience so they could tell just at a glance which was which
1330, 0 ### that's because getting only red eyed mosquitos violates a rule that is the absolute cornerstone of biology genetics
1331, 0 ### many of you have probably heard about so i'll just say briefly that is a tool that allows researchers to edit genes very precisely easily and quickly
1332, 1 ### so here yay rocks
1333, 0 ### but i want to share with you guys today my perspective as a geologist in how understanding earth's past can help inform and guide decisions that we make today about how to live on earth's surface
1334, 1 ### a sandwich can be delicious that parking space can be nearby and that game can be a blowout but not everything can be awesome
1335, 1 ### this author says snowy days or finding money in your pants is awesome
1336, 1 ### louis invented photography in and earlier today when you whipped out your and you took a shot of your awesome sandwich and you know who you are wasn't that easier than exposing the image to copper plates coated with silver i mean come on
1337, 1 ### but it's not like a flower can just get up and have sex with another flower although that would be awesome
1342, 0 ### pharaoh had his slaves move millions of blocks just to this site to erect a big freaking headstone
1344, 1 ### the one i like the best it's the biggest number with one syllable
1345, 1 ### you don't have to remember that part but trust me
1346, 1 ### and next year toilet paper
1347, 0 ### there's the tri fold
1348, 0 ### or there's the same thing but recycled paper you have to get five of those because they're not as absorbent of course
1349, 0 ### how as soon as it starts you just tear it off
1350, 1 ### but to the second question half of them that didn't like it they wanted it to continue
1351, 0 ### we faced many challenges
1353, 1 ### what about that and he would say aw that'll go away
1354, 1 ### you've heard a lot of wrong things about it anyway
1355, 1 ### but you can just look at the form
1356, 1 ### i'll just mention it
1358, 1 ### and he could have written quite an essay on what i did over my summer vacation
1359, 1 ### anyway there isn't
1360, 0 ### ok
1361, 0 ### the main thing i want to talk about is this that we have this remarkable experience in this field of fundamental physics that beauty is a very successful criterion for choosing the right theory
1363, 0 ### they have seven tentacles and they have little funny looking compound eyes and a brain shaped like a pretzel
1364, 0 ### but even if we don't run across it in our lifetimes we can still think there is one out there and we're just trying to get closer and closer to it
1365, 0 ### and he said here it is the business of natural philosophy to find out those laws
1366, 0 ### it's the fundamental law and this incredibly long series of accidents or chance outcomes that are there in addition
1367, 0 ### now what happens is that as we do that as we peel these skins of the onion and we get closer and closer to the underlying law we see that each skin has something in common with the previous one and with the next one
1368, 1 ### sometimes we spread out
1369, 1 ### you know we're interested in like you know an awkward interaction or a smile or a contemptuous glance or maybe a very awkward wink or maybe even something like a handshake
1371, 1 ### and humans do the same thing
1373, 1 ### you know and she gave the best comment ever and people turned around and were like oh my god i didn't even notice her sitting there
1374, 1 ### i don't have ego involved in this
1378, 0 ### so the arms up in the v the chin is slightly lifted
1379, 0 ### so again both animals and humans do the same thing
1381, 0 ### i notice a couple of things about this
1384, 1 ### she got cranky and just went home
1385, 1 ### so i thought wow i have to get some of this
1387, 1 ### you don't want to be people out just to save them it's really confusing
1389, 0 ### in the immortal germ line of human beings that is the eggs that sit in the ovaries they actually sit there in a state of suspended animation for up to years in the life of each woman
1390, 0 ### i was interested in what was going on in the bag the bag on the toy store shelf where those shrimp sat in suspended animation indefinitely
1391, 0 ### in the new england journal of medicine there was a study published that showed that with appropriate people who had suffered without a heartbeat for three hours could be brought back to life without any neurologic problems
1392, 1 ### crying about corals is having a moment guys
1395, 0 ### the northern great barrier reef lost two thirds of its corals last year over a distance of hundreds of miles then bleached again this year and the bleaching stretched further south
1396, 1 ### here's another couple
1397, 0 ### but before i do that let me tell you a couple of things that made this possible
1398, 1 ### but for a long time we couldn't quite figure out wow can we get these kinds of video inputs so i thought could we have darius serve as our carrier and that way get the inputs that we feed into dylan so that's what we did
1400, 0 ### the second piece of bad news will be delivered to you by who will tell you that if you are older than four or five years of age that even if you have your eye corrected the chances of your brain learning how to see are very very slim again slim or none
1402, 1 ### what a fish
1404, 1 ### let's call him don too
1406, 1 ### there was a long pause on the line and he said there's just too much chicken in the world
1409, 1 ### she kind of set us up
1410, 1 ### let's call him miguel actually his name is miguel
1415, 1 ### and every evening they fly miles back
1416, 1 ### i said miguel do they fly miles to the farm and then do they fly miles back at night do they do that for the children he looked at me like i had just quoted a whitney houston song
1417, 1 ### what we need now is a radically new conception of agriculture one in which the food actually tastes good
1419, 0 ### it's got a feed conversion ratio of to one
1422, 0 ### they did it by draining the land
1425, 0 ### and my head was swooning over that overcooked piece of delicious fish i had the night before
1427, 0 ### and we rounded the corner and saw the most amazing sight thousands and thousands of pink flamingos a literal pink carpet for as far as you could see
1428, 0 ### okay so let's review a farm that doesn't feed its animals and a farm that measures its success on the health of its predators
1429, 0 ### i mentioned that to miguel and he nodded
1430, 0 ### it's a river that carries with it all the things that rivers tend to carry these days chemical contaminants pesticide runoff
1432, 0 ### we should call it what it is a business in liquidation a business that's quickly eroding ecological capital that makes that very production possible
1440, 1 ### i said i'm just thinking about it a little bit
1441, 1 ### she said you're like the worst vulnerability role model ever
1443, 1 ### i had no contingency plan for four million
1444, 1 ### we'd appreciate it if you wouldn't mention vulnerability or shame
1445, 1 ### this is mostly to be honest with you from the business sector innovation creativity and change
1447, 1 ### so i'm like just keep walking she's on my six
1448, 0 ### i sat down and she said god you look like hell
1449, 0 ### and that myth is profoundly dangerous
1455, 0 ### i know you don't think that you're pretty smart talented or powerful enough
1456, 0 ### shame is a focus on self guilt is a focus on behavior
1458, 0 ### guilt inversely correlated with those things
1459, 0 ### which means yes i have a little shame no i'm a sociopath
1460, 0 ### and so i'll leave you with this thought
1461, 0 ### we want to be with you and across from you
1465, 1 ### but that was only true for the people who also believed that stress is harmful for your health
1466, 1 ### now the researchers estimated that over the eight years they were tracking deaths americans died prematurely not from stress but from the belief that stress is bad for you
1467, 1 ### now if that estimate is correct that would make believing stress is bad for you the largest cause of death in the united states last year killing more people than skin cancer and homicide
1468, 1 ### you come into the laboratory and you're told you have to give a five minute impromptu speech on your personal weaknesses to a panel of expert sitting right in front of you and to make sure you feel the pressure there are bright lights and a camera in your face kind of like this
1469, 1 ### and the have been trained to give you discouraging non verbal feedback like this
1470, 1 ### okay
1471, 1 ### we are going to have to start all over again
1473, 0 ### it increases the risk of everything from the common cold to cardiovascular disease
1475, 0 ### now in a typical stress response your heart rate goes up and your blood vessels constrict like this
1476, 0 ### and this is really what the new science of stress reveals that how you think about stress matters
1477, 0 ### now i said i have over a decade of demonizing stress to redeem myself from so we are going to do one more intervention
1478, 0 ### it primes you to do things that strengthen close relationships
1479, 0 ### your pituitary gland pumps this stuff out as part of the stress response
1480, 1 ### and it comes out in january and i hope you all buy it in triplicate
1481, 1 ### which should tell you something about that relationship
1482, 1 ### this was his horseradish
1483, 1 ### and he varied them according to every conceivable way that you can vary tomato sauce by sweetness by level of garlic by ness by tartness by by visible solids my favorite term in the spaghetti sauce business
1487, 1 ### even though at least a third of them deep in their hearts actually did
1489, 1 ### most of you like milky weak coffee
1491, 1 ### it's to make them turn their back on what they think they like now and reach out for something higher up the mustard hierarchy
1492, 1 ### third thing that howard did and perhaps the most important is howard confronted the notion of the platonic dish
1494, 0 ### and pepsi came to howard and they said you know there's this new thing called aspartame and we would like to make diet pepsi
1496, 0 ### they think well you know figuring out what people think about cola's not that easy
1499, 0 ### and that's where we got pickles
1501, 0 ### ten small bowls of pasta with a different spaghetti sauce on each one
1502, 0 ### instead he looked at the data and he said let's see if we can group all these different data points into clusters
1504, 0 ### what's in it yellow mustard seeds and paprika
1505, 0 ### mustard exists just like tomato sauce on a horizontal plane
1506, 0 ### no you just get the reduction
1507, 0 ### now that same idea fueled the commercial food industry as well
1508, 1 ### you people the church of ted are a very optimistic community
1509, 1 ### and according to the surveys we are marked the most pessimistic people in the world
1510, 0 ### the government and the opposition they have been simply paralyzed
1511, 0 ### this is the opening of a beautiful novel by jose called seeing
1513, 1 ### but he was the second child and the level of supervision had plummeted
1519, 0 ### there are plenty of exceptions and i will defend the disney princesses in front of any you
1522, 1 ### you didn't say that's a beautiful rainbow but it's kind of off to the left and if i could move it yards to the right it would be ever so much more beautiful
1526, 0 ### vast wealth can disappear tomorrow
1528, 1 ### at eight years old i took my ideas and started my own business called ideas and my nonprofit ideas for the planet
1529, 1 ### then one day forbes magazine contacted me when i was years old
1531, 0 ### there was a program on tv about jobs most kids don't know about
1532, 1 ### so here is a typical stud wall an architectural construction and this is a section of our proposal for a meat house where you can see we use fatty cells as insulation for dealing with wind loads and muscles for the doors and windows
1533, 0 ### as an architect i have to confront something like this
1534, 1 ### she was always saying things that made me stop and think like time may be a great healer but it ain't no beauty specialist
1535, 1 ### why without them you'd be a total stranger
1537, 1 ### the first thing i learned that day was that i never ever wanted to work that hard again
1539, 1 ### so we went over into michael's garage his dad had all kinds of stuff and we put a pipe in the vice there and screwed a cap on the end of the pipe drilled a hole in the back of the pipe took some of our firecrackers pulled out the fuses tied them together put them in the back there and down in that hole and then stuffed some of our gunpowder down that pipe and put three ball bearings on the top in the garage
1540, 1 ### two of them landed in the side door of his new citroen
1541, 1 ### we said well what are you going to do with it they said we're going to melt it down and make rocket fuel
1543, 0 ### one two three four
1544, 0 ### i'd go up and learn these old songs from her
1547, 0 ### hey hey hey hey
1548, 0 ### this is ralph stanley
1550, 0 ### just a few of them but maybe you'll get just a little hint of some of these folks
1551, 0 ### and he lived in that house that his great grandfather had built
1553, 1 ### i even went to the miss deaf america contest in nashville tennessee where people complained about that slurry southern signing
1554, 1 ### and his mother told me this story of coming home one day and he went to college nearby and she said i saw that car which you can always recognize in the parking lot of a bar she said
1555, 1 ### and when i see the way they're intersecting in conditions like the three i've just described i sometimes think it's like those moments in grand opera when the hero realizes he loves the heroine at the exact moment that she lies expiring on a divan
1557, 1 ### and when i asked the pediatrician what had been going on she said she thought in the morning he had probably had a cramp
1559, 0 ### and when she said it it made me anxious
1560, 0 ### i had thought of deafness entirely as an illness
1561, 0 ### she was facing the question of what to do with this child
1562, 0 ### those straight parents often want them to function in what they think of as the mainstream world and those gay people have to discover identity later on
1563, 0 ### and while some of them can be difficult there's no attempt to cure them
1564, 1 ### yesterday he said this
1565, 0 ### but i want to look at it a little bit from the short term and the long term perspective
1567, 1 ### in fact you can see the existential sadness in their eyes
1568, 1 ### if you want to remember one thing it's that you can't fetch the coffee if you're dead
1569, 1 ### repeat it to yourself three times a day
1571, 1 ### i arranged for his plane to be delayed
1574, 1 ### this is clearly following my wife's values which is happy wife happy life
1578, 1 ### and the robot sees the cat
1579, 1 ### and the robot hasn't quite learned the human value function properly so it doesn't understand the sentimental value of the cat outweighs the nutritional value of the cat
1581, 0 ### and i think this could be as some people have described it the biggest event in human history
1586, 0 ### the second law is a law of humility if you like
1588, 0 ### well i don't really know what wrong is but i know that i don't want to do it
1589, 0 ### you are better off with a machine that's designed in this way than without it
1590, 0 ### there's all kinds of things you don't want the robot doing
1591, 0 ### the real difficulties in fact are us
1592, 0 ### so it can deal with a certain amount of nastiness and it can even understand that your nastiness for example you may take bribes as a passport official because you need to feed your family and send your kids to school
1593, 0 ### so to understand his behavior we actually have to invert through a model of human cognition that includes our computational limitations a very complicated model
1595, 1 ### and he said let's get married
1597, 1 ### it's a feature
1598, 0 ### i'd pump him for information i'm mentally scribbling notes for the stories i plan to write
1601, 0 ### so we try another treatment aggressive nasty
1602, 1 ### my hair used to be straight
1604, 0 ### and after a while i began to perspire
1605, 0 ### thank you
1606, 1 ### i was called an idiot a traitor a scourge a and an ugly man and that was just in one email
1609, 1 ### now this guy doesn't agree with me yet
1612, 0 ### and incidentally that means that people don't like us
1613, 0 ### now i think sean hannity is percent politically wrong but his emotional correctness is strikingly impressive
1614, 1 ### for me law order tina fey and rock and judge judy the people are real the cases are real the rulings are final
1619, 0 ### but the number of arts participants people who write poetry who sing songs who perform in church choirs is exploding beyond our wildest imaginations
1620, 1 ### so there are a number of people who have a lot more uh oh moments than others and among the worst are recent graduates of business school
1621, 1 ### and of course there are teams that have a lot more ta da structures and among the best are recent graduates of kindergarten
1622, 1 ### who does the very best architects and engineers thankfully
1623, 1 ### on the team they get significantly better
1624, 0 ### and it was a huge success
1625, 0 ### sound familiar right
1626, 0 ### sound familiar right
1627, 0 ### and any team who manages and pays close attention to work will significantly improve the team's performance
1629, 1 ### it was terrific
1630, 1 ### now go to the equivalent in london in parliament square and you will see that the monument to david lloyd george contains three words david lloyd george
1634, 0 ### we need those face interactions where we learn the choreography of altruism and where we create those spiritual goods like friendship and trust and loyalty and love that redeem our solitude
1635, 0 ### we talked
1637, 1 ### i didn't have to talk to the flight attendant anymore
1641, 0 ### and i thought about my relationship with my wife with my friends with people
1644, 1 ### so let's have my dragon king burn this black swan concept
1645, 0 ### so the understanding of this great recession was that this was completely surprising this came out of the blue this was like the wrath of the gods
1646, 1 ### and so you have here a little example of a small skull what we call mini
1647, 1 ### and so that could be that could be potentially a good alternative to solar powered refrigerated camels
1648, 0 ### this material actually has some traits that make it seem almost too good to be true
1649, 0 ### the components of this material are just water and protein
1650, 1 ### without hesitation little dorothy responded yes daddy and fish swim backwards by wagging their heads
1651, 1 ### at this point most people really only care about the television show
1652, 1 ### and i played weasel who was the sort of nerdy character on the show which made it a very major acting challenge for me as a old boy
1653, 1 ### psychologists have a great term for it
1654, 1 ### i don't get visual feedback from people
1655, 0 ### we harbor bias
1656, 0 ### one fact is not true
1657, 0 ### it's about my vision
1658, 0 ### seeing is believing
1659, 0 ### reaching down to wash my hands i suddenly saw it was a i was touching not a sink when my fingers felt its true shape
1662, 1 ### somebody's going to get my college grades out a that's going to be a disaster
1664, 0 ### it was security
1666, 1 ### we were all scientists so we used our scientific creativity and came up with a very creative name for our project
1669, 1 ### in fact i saw some young adults playing this sport down the street from my house the other day and as far as i know there have been no reported concussions
1670, 0 ### that was the subject of the will smith movie concussion
1679, 1 ### that joke never got old
1684, 0 ### if you look at all of the ancient literature ancient chinese icelandic greek indian and even the original hebrew bible they all mention very few colors
1687, 0 ### and we think it is normal that a white employee is a better hire than a black employee
1689, 1 ### you know what his unsuccessful pickup line was he could make me feel again
1690, 0 ### so like me at a few of you may have also taken wrong turns and fallen in love with the wrong person maybe even your boss
1691, 0 ### but that wasn't my fate
1692, 1 ### i'm cutting my hair it's getting short and long because every time i saw kofi annan i was so worried that he thought i was a hippie that i cut it and that was kind of what was going on
1693, 0 ### i haven't got any qualifications
1694, 1 ### but the sound we are greeted with as the room is bathed in the simulated glow of late afternoon light recalls to mind a dirty men's room in the rear of a greek coffee shop
1695, 1 ### it's why they leave lights on around the house
1696, 1 ### that's the end
1697, 1 ### that's the end
1698, 1 ### upon his death in a quarter of the items were sold off for compote to a high class hotel restaurant
1701, 0 ### the most perfect examples occupy corner lots
1702, 0 ### from there to the modern dummy is but a brief moment in history
1703, 0 ### on a crowded bus there was always a lap to sit on
1705, 1 ### but i'm more like scotty in star trek
1706, 1 ### and i say no more fast looking and less german and bang the computer shows me an option
1707, 1 ### and by the way it's no accident that the drone body looks just like the pelvis of a flying squirrel
1708, 1 ### unlike maggie
1709, 1 ### what's basically happening is computers are going from being like spock to being a lot more like kirk
1711, 1 ### as an experiment we set it up to help a person working in construction doing repetitive tasks tasks like cutting out holes for outlets or light switches in drywall
1712, 1 ### look i'm sure that the designers imagined this lifestyle for barbie when they designed her
1715, 0 ### over the course of the next years more will change around the way we do our work than has happened in the last
1716, 0 ### in fact for the last three half million years the tools that we've had have been completely passive
1717, 0 ### and maggie did three things she had to pay attention she had to remember what happened and she had to retain and create a pattern in her mind
1718, 0 ### and then a couple of weeks ago beats the world's best human at go which is the most difficult game that we have
1722, 0 ### this one's a little bit crazy
1723, 0 ### and then we did something crazy
1725, 0 ### we're going to have a world with more variety more more dynamism more complexity more adaptability and of course more beauty
1726, 1 ### and i can actually recommend this book it's a very nice book
1727, 1 ### we get this dot dancing around
1729, 1 ### sounds kind of boring but listen to them together
1734, 0 ### so let's have a look at these patterns
1736, 0 ### when we throw something up in the air it falls down
1737, 0 ### that enables him as a choreographer to do cool stuff to do new things because he has represented it
1740, 1 ### you have to have the right attitude to agree to do it
1743, 1 ### i guarantee you that will never happen again
1745, 0 ### i'll go over some science experiments and cover three musical experiments
1748, 0 ### when an area of the brain is active meaning a neural area is active it gets blood flow shunted to that area
1752, 1 ### it must have been a very unusual day for him
1753, 1 ### it was not very comfortable
1754, 0 ### and the way to it for me was through artistic means
1755, 0 ### i also started looking around in the city and trying to photograph them
1756, 1 ### and the reason that that's relevant is that very soon i will be walking into what we call a stage two tribe which looks like this
1758, 1 ### and you're not
1764, 0 ### this was before super tuesday
1765, 0 ### that is in fact what great tribal leaders do
1766, 1 ### or at least i wrote an essay and then i wrote a book called bad feminist and then in interviews people started calling me the bad feminist
1767, 1 ### when i was younger mostly in my teens and i had strange ideas about feminists as hairy angry man hating sex hating women as if those are bad things
1772, 1 ### listen if that's good feminism i am a very bad feminist
1773, 0 ### i hold certain truths to be self evident women are equal to men
1774, 0 ### when we talk about the needs of women we have to consider the other identities we inhabit
1779, 0 ### i hope that we can all be a little bit brave when we most need such bravery
1780, 1 ### i saw it in the early days when i was some of those videos on and i realized that people who were not my cousins were watching
1781, 1 ### most of the comments are not thank you
1782, 1 ### say home building
1783, 1 ### do what you can
1784, 1 ### i'll give it an percent
1786, 0 ### but when they were a bit older they took a little agency and decided to engage
1787, 0 ### in a traditional academic model we group students together usually by age and around middle school by age and perceived ability and we shepherd them all together at the same pace
1789, 0 ### but what was really broken was the process
1790, 0 ### it means that you should just keep working on it
1791, 0 ### the teacher had to give different worksheets to every student give on demand assessments
1793, 1 ### we actually saw seals out of our car window and we pulled over to take a quick picture of them and then blocked them with our giant heads
1794, 1 ### i was trying to remind myself of the simple universal little pleasures that we all love but we just don't talk about enough things like waiters and waitresses who bring you free refills without asking being the first table to get called up to the dinner buffet at a wedding wearing warm underwear from just out of the dryer or when cashiers open up a new check out lane at the grocery store and you get to be first in line even if you were last at the other line swoop right in there
1795, 1 ### although i should say that my traffic did skyrocket and go up by percent when she forwarded it to my dad
1797, 1 ### in his deeply authentic self he also loved needlepoint
1798, 1 ### and he even put out a book called rosey grier's needlepoint for men
1800, 1 ### and it's a great story because what happened was he got off the plane at the toronto airport and he was welcomed by a non profit group which i'm sure someone in this room runs
1801, 1 ### and when my dad tells the story he says the craziest thing was i'd never seen any of that before except bread
1803, 0 ### they saw their first dentist they ate their first hamburger and they had their first kids
1805, 0 ### we talked about the tv show we watched that evening
1807, 0 ### it's not a happy thought but your kids could get mixed up in gangs or bad scenes
1808, 0 ### i love the way that they see the world because they're seeing the world for the first time
1809, 0 ### that three boy is still part of you
1810, 0 ### and for this one i want to tell you a quick story
1811, 0 ### and you end you end up following your heart and feeling very fulfilled
1814, 1 ### i sent out some messages some messages and i gave people the opportunity to buy the naming rights to my ted talk
1815, 1 ### but that being said it's a very good media opportunity
1817, 1 ### and as i said earlier i put myself in some pretty horrible situations over the years but nothing could prepare me nothing could ready me for anything as difficult or as dangerous as going into the rooms with these guys
1819, 1 ### no
1820, 1 ### but why well transparency is scary like that odd still screaming bear
1823, 1 ### that's a great question
1824, 1 ### well we can't all be brand tom but i do often find myself at the intersection of dark glamor and casual fly
1825, 1 ### we've got to put that bear in a cage
1826, 1 ### i have in my pocket a check made out to the parent organization to the ted organization the sapling foundation a check for to be applied toward my attendance for next year's ted
1827, 0 ### it's what it's redundant
1828, 0 ### forever
1829, 0 ### you're going to see the whole thing take place in this movie
1833, 0 ### ms okay
1834, 0 ### they wanted absolutely nothing to do with this project
1835, 0 ### but with only one company one agency willing to help me and that's only because i knew john bond and richard kirshenbaum for years i realized that i would have to go on my own i'd have to cut out the middleman and go to the companies myself with all of my team
1837, 0 ### whether it's a floral fusion or a paradise winds they'll have their chance
1838, 0 ### how do we keep you fresher longer better freshness more freshness three times fresher
1842, 1 ### it's kind of important
1844, 1 ### natalia had found a giant arctic camel
1848, 0 ### now one summer day in she was at a dig site called the leaf bed which is less than degrees latitude away from the magnetic north pole
1849, 0 ### i get out the hand lens i'm looking a little bit more closely and realizing it doesn't quite look like this has tree rings
1854, 0 ### they tell the history of our universe of our planet of life on this planet
1855, 0 ### you could learn some tiny thing that forces you to everything you thought you knew
1860, 1 ### now i would like to suggest to you all that gardening is a subversive activity
1861, 1 ### it's not long after you plant a garden that you start to say hey i need to start to learn how to cook
1862, 1 ### now the other thing of course with planting a garden especially a garden in front of a white house and on a sunny south lawn is you never know who you might influence
1864, 1 ### and so this is sort of what i'm aspiring to here
1865, 1 ### and i want to share some of those with you right now starting off in the form of a very short video i've produced for you which is my best effort to sum up the history of gastronomy in about seconds
1866, 1 ### so it sort of leaves us feeling like this
1868, 1 ### and as i said before you never know who you might inspire
1869, 1 ### however this is not a good representation of our federal agriculture policy
1870, 1 ### i also think that we need to examine the composition of the movement right now
1871, 0 ### so i'm going to share it with you now but you have to promise me you're going to share it in turn
1872, 0 ### that's three times the population of the united states
1874, 0 ### we'll also need to grow more food with less farmland
1875, 0 ### well we shouldn't be doing the same with our tomatoes either
1876, 0 ### in this case it was in europe and we think it was started with bean sprouts of all things
1877, 0 ### instead of seeing this as a yard we need to think of it more as like a full service
1878, 0 ### and in fact they know how to grow some of it themselves
1880, 0 ### we need a road map and i picked this slide for a reason
1881, 0 ### we're already using the tax code to encourage green transport and green shelter
1883, 0 ### and i think we can take some inspiration from a previous movement which was the grange movement a rural movement which brought farmers together in a single building to meet and to recreate and learn how to become better farmers
1884, 1 ### and they sent this bureaucrat down to tell geiger that he was expected to use their dollars for medical care to which geiger famously and logically responded the last time i checked my textbooks the specific therapy for malnutrition was food
1885, 0 ### we had moms who would come in daughter has asthma wakes up covered in cockroaches every morning
1886, 1 ### yeah
1887, 0 ### and i found poems by andrew marvell and matthew arnold and emily dickinson and william butler yeats because they were quoted in science fiction and i loved their sounds and i went on to read about rima and medial and and all that other technical stuff that you care about if you already care about poems because poems already made me happier and sadder and more alive
1888, 1 ### oh sorry
1889, 1 ### that's a dolphin tail there guys
1895, 0 ### it's more difficult
1897, 0 ### our second type of error is a false negative
1901, 1 ### there were rejected sheep that didn't meet sheep like criteria and were thrown out of the flock
1902, 1 ### but only one of them out of the said this
1904, 0 ### so i'm going to show you a few of the projects that i've been working on over the last couple years that reflect on our lives and our systems
1907, 0 ### moving across to the west coast you see san francisco and los angeles big low traffic zones across nevada and arizona
1909, 1 ### weird
1910, 0 ### this is scary because when the economy doesn't grow our children don't get better lives
1913, 1 ### she was the kind of teacher that was like victor i'm here for you whenever you're ready
1914, 1 ### now it's time to go to college
1917, 1 ### hey i'm here for you whenever you're ready
1920, 0 ### she was culturally relevant she respected my community my people my family
1921, 0 ### and my uncle he would look me in the eyes and he would say to me vida
1922, 0 ### these people are at risk these people are truant
1925, 1 ### so it was a little discouraging to the students
1927, 1 ### and actually like nick i brought samples
1928, 1 ### they're fully functional field tested ready to roll out
1929, 1 ### and this is about the most exciting thing in my life right now which is perhaps a sad commentary on my life
1931, 1 ### and we're a pretty small staff which is me
1933, 0 ### so the rains come they go down the rivers and the flooding happens
1934, 0 ### so not surprisingly there's a lot of effort that's been done to look at alternative cooking fuels
1935, 0 ### you see these all over haiti as well
1936, 0 ### so over the next couple of years students and i worked to develop a process
1938, 0 ### it's cow dung
1939, 0 ### and what we could use as a binder was actually small amounts of cow manure which they used ordinarily for their fuel
1940, 1 ### convert their into your fuel
1941, 1 ### two that i needed another sponsor and fast
1942, 1 ### here's another confession i have found that our daughter is actually more successful at teaching him these skills than i am
1943, 0 ### as she tucked in my side i bent down and explained that these were the rulers of the who had worked hard to develop their nation and preserve its unity
1944, 0 ### my father didn't have a son and so i in a sense became his
1945, 0 ### i had teamed up with john and was working hard hoping he would notice how great i was and that he would come to support my case to make partner at the firm
1946, 1 ### but as i said the military and the police are very different
1948, 1 ### that spike was all victoria
1949, 1 ### i'm going to go out on a limb here and say that if queensland police didn't have spray they wouldn't have shot people in those two years
1952, 1 ### apparently she took up a more threatening position in her bed
1954, 0 ### since they're doing some of the same jobs maybe they should have some of those things
1955, 0 ### if the person doesn't follow directions they may end up shooting them and then find out afterwards either yes we shot the right person or no this was just an innocent person who didn't understand what was going on
1956, 0 ### so again they'd say with access to nonlethal weapons if we've got someone we know is hostile we can do something to deal with them and know that if we hit anyone else at least we're not going to kill them
1959, 0 ### the police minister's and a heap of public statements were made about it
1962, 1 ### i went miles out of delhi into a really remote village where the chances of a passing software development engineer was very little
1963, 1 ### when they saw me they said we want a faster processor and a better mouse
1964, 1 ### in an irritated voice they said you've given us a machine that works only in english so we had to teach ourselves english in order to use it
1965, 1 ### i gave them a speech engine in a computer and i said keep talking into it until it types what you say
1966, 1 ### i said i haven't the foggiest idea
1968, 1 ### i know more british grandmothers than anyone in the universe
1970, 0 ### the british empire imagine trying to run the show trying to run the entire planet without computers without telephones with data handwritten on pieces of paper and traveling by ships
1971, 0 ### they made another machine to produce those people the school
1973, 0 ### it's wonderfully constructed
1974, 0 ### those people don't need to be able to write beautifully by hand
1977, 0 ### and he's teaching her how to browse
1979, 0 ### i found a village
1980, 1 ### it has been
1986, 1 ### eventually the whole number gets dialed and i'm listening to the phone and my colleague picks up the phone and he says to me woo woo woo woo

1991, 0 ### we are energy beings connected to one another through the consciousness of our right as one human family
1993, 0 ### i am
1996, 1 ### one of you make this
1998, 0 ### once upon a time in america going to college did not mean graduating with debt
2002, 1 ### it did tell me that this maybe missing sidewalks or pedestrian paths though
2003, 0 ### and i think this is what we've done with climate change
2004, 1 ### first you get one stone then several more and more and more and more and more and then they well i will not do that
2005, 0 ### it's a noisy material and if we produce roads like in the netherlands very close to cities then we would like a silent road
2010, 1 ### it has also become a very popular backdrop for wedding photography

2020, 0 ### standing outside her shelter i saw the two white sand football fields where basil used to play
2021, 0 ### forced evictions are incredibly violent and of course unconstitutional
2022, 0 ### yet another settlement recently completed a flood safe eco friendly communal toilet system
2023, 0 ### but people like cities are resilient and no amount of legislation or intimidation or violence can fully eliminate any of us
2030, 1 ### in france where independent thinking is not necessarily promoted
2031, 1 ### and for motivation we used what i think is the most powerful pharmacology of switzerland fine swiss chocolate
2032, 0 ### it was just at the end of a regular day of work with the foundation
2033, 0 ### and for this purpose we placed two on opposite sides of the body
2035, 1 ### we didn't wait any prerequisite amount of time for our courtship we told each other the vulnerable truths up front i am a man which means the f on my birth certificate should have stood for false instead of female
2036, 1 ### and in those messages between us we collapsed time we it we laid it all on the table
2037, 1 ### but kim said that i was her ideal the heartbroken mess that i was
2039, 1 ### i often kind of sum up the differences in our strengths by saying keep me safe and i'll keep you wild
2041, 1 ### so sprinting towards her hand in marriage was the thing that i could do
2042, 0 ### this doesn't make me natural or normal this is just one way of describing the many different ways that we exist in this world
2044, 0 ### i love him whole pre transition now and in the future
2046, 0 ### it's because of these things that we are able to be hopeful open receptive and shape shifting
2047, 0 ### and we don't have any blueprints
2048, 0 ### the possibility that we are practicing is about reinventing time love and institutions
2049, 0 ### and we learned this love in our chat rooms in our clubs in our bars and in our community centers
2050, 1 ### that was it
2051, 0 ### then he says to himself very quietly turbulent the sea stretching across to sado the milky way

2058, 1 ### and his grandfather who was a wise man said oh so you belong to the atheist branch of the hindu tradition
2059, 0 ### what i want to persuade you of today is of a very simple claim which is that these debates are in a certain sense preposterous because there is no such thing as religion about which to make these claims
2060, 0 ### in his book on primitive culture he says the heart of religion is what he called animism that is the belief in spiritual agency belief in spirits
2062, 1 ### the second one was an hour and then they became half hours and all i noticed was my bald spot getting bigger

2065, 0 ### suddenly on september the world got bigger
2066, 0 ### so that was easy
2070, 1 ### think this is somebody who is incredibly vulnerable and in need of love
2072, 1 ### even though she is much richer than any of you are and she's got a very large house the reason why we don't envy her is because she's too weird
2073, 1 ### it's made to feel by magazines and other media outlets that if you've got energy a few bright ideas about technology a garage you too could start a major thing
2074, 1 ### a few years ago i was thinking about this and i went to the sunday sport a tabloid newspaper i don't recommend you start reading if you're not familiar with it already
2075, 1 ### i mentioned othello they'd not heard of it but were fascinated
2077, 1 ### then my favorite they really do have a kind of genius of their own these guys my favorite is oedipus the king sex with mum was blinding
2078, 0 ### why we might be victims of these career crises as we're weeping softly into our pillows
2079, 0 ### and it's a beautiful idea
2082, 0 ### nowadays particularly in the united states if you meet someone at the bottom of society they may be described as a loser
2083, 0 ### and some of the reason for that is that people take what happens to them extremely personally they own their success but they also own their failure
2084, 0 ### but i think it's insane to believe that we will ever make a society that is genuinely it's an impossible dream
2087, 0 ### he is not a loser though he has lost
2089, 1 ### i want to talk about the next six months
2090, 1 ### it was weird
2093, 1 ### now if we want to move forward into a different future than the one we have right now because i don't think we've hit is not peak civilization
2094, 1 ### so you can imagine it's a very peaceful quiet meal
2095, 1 ### i don't do this in the restaurant because it would be bizarre but i have to i did it once and that's how i learned it was bizarre

2098, 0 ### we did the transcontinental railroad the marshall plan
2099, 0 ### and then we build without even thinking about how people are going to get between them and their job
2101, 0 ### if you go to the self help section in any bookstore it's all about you
2103, 0 ### because our problems are so big and so vast that we need to open ourselves up
2104, 0 ### this comes from the greek root
2107, 0 ### it requires action
2108, 1 ### as a patient i need to do sit and stand movements and when i stand up i bid for the items i want to buy
2109, 0 ### many years later my mom developed frozen shoulder which leads to pain and stiffness in the shoulder
2111, 1 ### i wanted a registered retirement savings plan that would keep me in candy long enough to make old age sweet
2112, 1 ### now not so much
2113, 1 ### when i was nine i saw the movie jaws and thought to myself no thank you
2115, 1 ### i was going to be the garbage man
2117, 1 ### and then this guy duke the dumpster stole my entire shtick
2118, 1 ### i was crushed as if by a trash compactor
2119, 0 ### and that's hard to do if you don't know who you are
2120, 0 ### i said i'd like to be a writer
2122, 0 ### so broken bled the blues and we tried to empty ourselves so we'd feel nothing
2123, 0 ### outside we'd have to rehearse running away or learn to stay still like statues giving no clues that we were there
2124, 0 ### he tried to kill himself in grade when a kid who could still go home to mom and dad had the audacity to tell him get over it
2126, 0 ### because maybe you didn't belong to a group or a clique
2127, 0 ### we stem from a root planted in the belief that we are not what we were called
2128, 1 ### even in north korea i was an f student
2129, 1 ### that chicken wing changed my life
2130, 1 ### in korean you can do english then korean as well
2131, 1 ### i will live my life happily and study hard until i see you and i promise i will not cry again
2132, 0 ### i would wander the streets searching for food and i remember seeing a small child tied to a mother's back eating chips and wanting to steal them from him
2133, 0 ### i saw my father wither away and die
2134, 0 ### my daily life became very hard but very simple
2135, 0 ### i was not uncommon
2136, 1 ### so that overmatched capability creates problems catastrophic successes the white house calls them
2137, 1 ### so we say area denial anti access asymmetrical strategies and their eyes glaze over
2139, 1 ### i don't know the million man swim
2140, 1 ### a banana peel on the tarmac
2141, 1 ### and that poor country runs off that ledge does that cartoon thing and then drops
2142, 1 ### and let's call this red line i don't know mission accomplished
2143, 1 ### they can put it in an envelope and mail it to you and then say in no uncertain terms please cut that out
2144, 1 ### it will cost you billion dollars
2146, 1 ### and then we look over the body and we find an old cigarette lighter and we say jesus it was dark
2147, 1 ### i'm not talking about the difference between reality and desire which i can do because i'm not inside the beltway
2149, 1 ### so they start moving from reality towards desire and they create their own special language to describe their voyage of self discovery and self
2151, 1 ### for eight years after screwing up the relationship on day one inauguration day with gays in the military which was deft
2152, 1 ### it's like the guy who goes to the doctor and says doctor it hurts when i do this
2155, 1 ### now we've got a home game and an away game
2158, 1 ### leviathan traditional partners they all look like the brits and their former colonies
2159, 1 ### i like them young male unmarried slightly pissed off
2160, 1 ### so yes it begins inside the pentagon but over time it's going to cross that river
2161, 1 ### who gets custody of the kids this is where the marines in the audience get kind of tense
2162, 0 ### it's the one that takes me around the world right now interacting with foreign militaries quite a bit
2163, 0 ### we can run the score up against anybody and then get our asses kicked in the second half what they call fourth generation warfare
2164, 0 ### we did it so fast we weren't prepared for their collapse
2165, 0 ### you have to access coalition partners
2167, 0 ### but it's not a perfect world and your administration isn't getting us any closer
2168, 0 ### we don't do the everything else so well
2169, 0 ### i think we have an unparalleled capacity to wage war
2173, 0 ### they said you're that powerful you can resurrect this country
2174, 0 ### check out their agenda since
2175, 0 ### you've got to track coalition partners
2176, 0 ### it's not our system of governance
2177, 0 ### it makes me very popular as well
2178, 0 ### a big stick a baton stick
2180, 0 ### but i know this organization doesn't change until it experiences failure
2181, 0 ### it's why i travel all over the world talking to foreign militaries
2182, 0 ### that force is the force that never comes home does most of your work
2184, 0 ### and you've got to wage war here in such a way to facilitate that
2185, 0 ### armor goes this way
2188, 1 ### but it has to be technological so i'll talk about electroshock therapy
2191, 1 ### i know some people who got tenure in that place with lies like that
2193, 0 ### and then we fast forward to about when three italian psychiatrists who were largely treating depression began to notice among their patients who were also that if they had an epileptic a series of epileptic fits a lot of them in a row the depression would very frequently lift
2195, 0 ### but they wrote a paper about this and everybody in the western world began using electricity to people who were either schizophrenic or severely depressed
2197, 0 ### and the reason that it has had a renaissance is that probably about percent of the people severe do not respond regardless of what is done for them
2198, 1 ### my friend paul used to say in his late that he felt like a young man with something really wrong with him
2200, 1 ### i don't think it's an ideal system
2202, 1 ### and if it's someone else's problem you probably don't have the answer anyway
2203, 1 ### don't get your help and goodness all over everybody
2204, 1 ### it will only make you worse than you already are
2205, 1 ### one acronym for god is the gift of desperation g or as a sober friend put it by the end i was deteriorating faster than i could lower my standards
2206, 0 ### they do it by with themselves
2207, 0 ### the most degraded and evil people i've ever known are male writers who've had huge best sellers
2208, 0 ### laughter really is carbonated holiness
2209, 0 ### emerson said that the happiest person on earth is the one who learns from nature the lessons of worship
2211, 0 ### also the people will make you laugh out loud at the most inconvenient times and that's the great good news
2212, 0 ### it's hard to believe but it's the truest thing i know
2213, 0 ### i think that's it but if i think of anything else i'll let you know
2214, 1 ### and the client was saying no it's a day
2216, 1 ### and everybody's crying now
2217, 1 ### the day after when really it became a lot of talking i said to myself and my wife said to me i also want a poster so this is her
2218, 1 ### they have graphic designers
2219, 0 ### it's not just one dude making one poster it's we can be part of it so they start sending me pictures and ask me make me a poster
2221, 0 ### i love that star
2222, 0 ### it's a two way story
2223, 0 ### and it became really big at some point
2225, 0 ### and here they are these goals are the product of a massive consultation exercise
2226, 1 ### i had transplant envy i guess

2232, 1 ### whenever i get to travel for work i try to find out where my drinking water comes from and where my poop and pee go
2233, 1 ### but thinking about where it all goes is the first step in activating what are actually superpowers in our poop and pee
2234, 1 ### i'll use a mix
2236, 1 ### think of your poo and pee as a health for a tree
2237, 1 ### let's design to make it beautiful as advanced potty training
2238, 1 ### brave and open minded people sat down and felt comfortable saying yeah that shit makes sense
2241, 0 ### this approach is called integrated water management or holistic or closed loop
2243, 0 ### we want more innovation
2244, 0 ### the second reason is we think the problem is solved here in the us
2245, 0 ### our rainwater and our sewage go to the same treatment plant
2246, 0 ### that dark brown poo in the toilet is dark brown because of what dead stuff bacteria
2247, 0 ### healthier people

2257, 0 ### in researchers discovered that the mixture of breast milk and baby saliva specifically baby saliva causes a chemical reaction that produces hydrogen peroxide that can kill and salmonella
2258, 0 ### and many women do not have knowledgeable clinical support

2311, 1 ### i can't tell you the rest because i'm out of time
2317, 0 ### i've done it for years
2318, 0 ### when i get those calls about performance that's one thing

2363, 0 ### chris anderson the editor of wired defended his choice and said there aren't enough women prominent women in technology to sell a cover to sell an issue
2365, 0 ### this is an important point to consider because much of our foreign policy now revolves around countries where the treatment of women is an issue such as afghanistan
2366, 1 ### in fact the more inspired a story makes me feel very often the more nervous i get
2367, 1 ### when asked to describe their lives what is interesting is how few people said mess
2368, 1 ### i don't think anyone said my life is a reality tv show
2370, 1 ### for instance just to get out of bed in the morning you tell yourself the story that your job is really important what you're doing is really important and maybe it is but i tell myself that story even when it's not
2371, 1 ### i won't be
2372, 1 ### you're like hey a free story and you end up buying the product because the product and the story go together
2373, 1 ### story a is buy this car and you will have beautiful romantic partners and a fascinating life
2374, 0 ### they contain a lot of information
2376, 0 ### as a simple rule of thumb just imagine that every time you're telling a good versus evil story you're basically lowering your by ten points or more
2378, 0 ### so when i'm really doing something that is actually just a waste of time in my mess of a life i'm too tied into my story that got me out of bed and ideally i ought to have some very complex story map in my mind you know with and a matrix of computation and the like but that is not how stories work
2379, 0 ### i'm not sure i was the bad guy in the sense of having evil intent but it was very hard for me to get away with that story
2380, 0 ### you can never get out of the pattern of thinking in terms of stories but you can improve the extent to which you think in stories and make some better decisions
2381, 0 ### there is a gabriel garcia marquez memoir living to tell the tale that we use memory in stories to make sense of what we've done to give meaning to our lives to establish connections with other people
2382, 1 ### you've all done it
2383, 1 ### now polls show that men tell twice as many lies as women assuming the women they asked told the truth
2384, 0 ### and i'm going to use them to tell you a little bit about my favorite subject deception
2386, 1 ### so it's interesting for me when i'm looking for someone who can really talk to me and talk to an audience about these things that probably one of the most important people in the world who can discuss toxicity in babies is expert in frogs
2387, 1 ### it was a surprise to me as well that i would be talking about pesticides that i'd be talking about public health because in fact i never thought i would do anything useful
2389, 1 ### now my wife tells me and i'm sure penelope can as well that there's nothing more painful than childbirth which that i'll never experience i can't really argue that but i would guess that a dozen chicken eggs in my testicle would probably be somewhere in the top five
2391, 0 ### in canada we're now looking at one in canadian children with asthma
2392, 0 ### but what does is it turns on an enzyme the machinery if you will that converts testosterone into estrogen
2393, 0 ### what's interesting is in fact the same company that sold us million pounds of the breast cancer promoter now sells us the blocker the exact same company
2396, 1 ### so we sucked up
2398, 1 ### that was an essay i wrote when i was years old and i got a b
2399, 1 ### and i'm gonna try and do that within the time span that we were told to stay within and to follow the ted commandments that is actually something that creates a near death experience but near death is good for creativity
2400, 1 ### there is also the uncertainty principle which is part of quantum mechanics as i understand it
2401, 1 ### and so i am going to just throw in string theory here and just say that creative people are and there are levels i think of anxiety
2402, 0 ### now in the nature area we look at whether or not we are innately equipped with something perhaps in our brains some abnormal chromosome that causes this muse like effect
2404, 0 ### and then i also wasn't really shining in a certain area that i wanted to be and you know you look at those scores and it wasn't bad but it was not certainly predictive that i would one day make my living out of the artful arrangement of words
2405, 0 ### and my mother believed that something had gone wrong and she was gonna find out what it was and she was gonna fix it
2406, 1 ### in fact one of the voices actually dictated the answers during the exam which technically possibly counts as cheating
2407, 0 ### but i was skilled at hiding it and from the outside appeared to be someone with everything to hope for and aspire to
2408, 1 ### and you know that chris would say thank you
2410, 1 ### one of the things about appearing later on in the ted week is that gradually as the days go by all the other speakers cover most of what you were going to say
2411, 1 ### and so this morning i thought oh well i'll just do a card trick
2412, 0 ### and somebody was talking about metaphors on monday
2415, 0 ### no no not going to do it
2416, 1 ### i stayed thrilled until i got home threw the helmet onto my bed fell down onto my bed and realized inside there was an inscription
2417, 1 ### we are for decorative purposes only
2418, 1 ### at first blush you think hey it's crazy what could you possibly gain we created what we like to call
2419, 1 ### now if there is anyone here from american airlines please consider doing your christmas party here
2420, 1 ### again just a couple people are required
2421, 0 ### so eventually we have found ourselves in a totally marginalized position way over here
2422, 0 ### now something else happened
2423, 0 ### now if we do this i believe we can go back years and start agency social engineering back into architecture
2424, 0 ### this is the moment in which you as the architect and your client can begin to inject vision and agency
2425, 0 ### but i promise you with enough brain power and enough passion and enough commitment you will arrive at conclusions that will transcend convention and will simply be something that you could not have initially or individually conceived of
2426, 1 ### the curator said to me that's ridiculous you know this is new york this chair will be empty nobody has time to sit in front of you
2427, 1 ### and then after you finish you get a certificate of accomplishment so get home and frame it if you want
2428, 1 ### and if you fall asleep which is very possible because it's been a long day you're going to be transported to the parking lot
2429, 1 ### counting rice will be another thing
2430, 0 ### some of the objects are a glass of water a coat a shoe a rose
2431, 0 ### people would give me the glass of water to drink they'd give me the rose
2432, 0 ### and another person took the pistol and they started a fight
2433, 0 ### and i looked at myself in the mirror and i had a piece of gray hair
2434, 1 ### here's the section on the all important emergency stop switch
2435, 1 ### it's a lot of fun
2436, 1 ### that's the scourge of daycare centers everywhere it's like basically
2437, 1 ### so i mean we wanted it to work
2438, 1 ### well doesn't have canine distemper that's probably good
2440, 0 ### i took a bunch of these small like the common cold like polio and so on and i just broke them down into small segments
2441, 0 ### and so we can encapsulate these regions of ultra conservation through evolution how these viruses evolved by just choosing elements or elements in these regions to represent on our chip as detection reagents
2442, 0 ### now if the sequences match they'll stick together and so we can look at spots
2444, 1 ### and then when my mom noticed she got really upset
2445, 1 ### and this was what my notebooks looked like in law school
2447, 1 ### the nigerian in me was like nah
2448, 0 ### you see the are an ethnic group from the southwestern part of nigeria and i was always fascinated by these stories
2449, 0 ### as a child i thought she was born with them with beautiful black lines and detailed symbols
2451, 0 ### so in this one you see the map of africa you see the questions you see crying and there you see syringes plugged into africa and the natural resources being drained out
2452, 1 ### maybe a few hours on sunday
2453, 1 ### it's just not true
2455, 1 ### of course these people don't really look like scientists because they're much too happy
2457, 0 ### and indeed this is actually true for most scientists as well outside of their own specialties
2459, 0 ### so there are many famous examples in the history of science of scientists doing exactly this
2462, 1 ### so i said to myself with all these hundred other boys this is where i belong
2463, 0 ### and i stayed
2464, 1 ### red
2465, 0 ### so this incident that i'm going to describe really began with some diarrhea
2468, 1 ### she latched on to the word chicken which isn't the best but certainly is not the worst
2469, 1 ### would you describe it as a whirlwind romance no no no
2470, 1 ### yes
2471, 1 ### i'm not sure people would describe it entirely that way
2472, 1 ### now if any of you guys would ever come to our house in tucson for the first time gabby would usually go up to the freezer and pull out the piece of tupperware that has the real skull
2473, 1 ### we have a lot of connections with prisons apparently
2474, 0 ### people don't realize that
2475, 0 ### i called her back and that's when she told me that gabby had been shot in the head
2478, 0 ### she understands everything but the communication is just very difficult because when you look at the picture the part of your brain where those communication centers are are on the left side of your head which is where the bullet passed through
2480, 1 ### no one is closer to chancellor merkel than the swiss diplomats
2481, 1 ### if people are spying on us it stands to reason that they have to listen to what we are saying
2482, 1 ### they weren't as sophisticated as those used by the americans and the british
2483, 1 ### the academy of arts joined the project and so we built another large antenna on their rooftop exactly between the listening posts of the and the
2486, 1 ### please send a drone strike
2489, 0 ### if we become aware of the constellation the terms and conditions of communication it not only broadens our horizon it allows us to look behind the regulations that limit our our specific social political or aesthetic conventions
2490, 0 ### on the contrary every time they appear every time they risk becoming visible merely gives grounds for further persecution expulsion and suppression
2491, 0 ### people can stay there
2492, 0 ### in the world of globalization the continents are drifting closer to each other
2493, 0 ### these procedures are declared to be secret military operations
2494, 1 ### it's even longer than the time it takes for italy to form a stable government
2495, 0 ### in the eye of a theoretical physicist the higgs is a clever explanation of how some elementary particles gain mass but it seems a fairly unsatisfactory and incomplete solution
2496, 1 ### why is it that x is the unknown x is the unknown because you can't say sh in spanish
2497, 0 ### to write a word or a phrase or a sentence in arabic is like crafting an equation because every part is extremely precise and carries a lot of information
2500, 1 ### and that's how i became an an eclipse chaser
2503, 0 ### now the thing about total eclipses is if you wait for one to come to you you're going to be waiting a long time
2504, 0 ### and it was all very interesting but i wouldn't say it was spectacular
2507, 1 ### and now the trick is getting them back
2508, 0 ### and no one really knew how significant these protests were because for whatever reason the world media largely ignored it
2510, 1 ### and i said i'm learning
2512, 0 ### i started to worry about the fact that a lot of people don't get their portraits painted anymore and they're amazing people and we want to deliver them to future generations
2514, 1 ### if it's gone it's gone and if you're really lucky you might get something growing back from the bottom
2515, 0 ### let's start our journey on the forest floor of one of my study sites in costa rica
2516, 1 ### it's a crazy matrix experience
2522, 0 ### so moving on swiftly
2524, 1 ### you know i found that volcano on images not realizing how much it makes me look like the cover of dianetics
2528, 1 ### ever since that jayson blair jerk ruined it for all of us
2530, 1 ### they have coverage like the size of my thumbnail
2531, 1 ### this is me with a camcorder on a phone going like this
2532, 1 ### i don't get that
2536, 1 ### everyone wants in on the action
2539, 1 ### your home phone your work phone your cell phone your yacht phone
2540, 1 ### i got the chinese line
2541, 1 ### two
2542, 1 ### hold on
2550, 1 ### nailed that one
2552, 1 ### and they also promise that they're going to transcribe only the gist of your messages
2553, 1 ### ok talk to you later bye
2557, 0 ### so you can pick up the phone you hear a dial tone but its just a fake out
2560, 0 ### which is why most people with this service get into the habit of saying hey i just got home
2563, 0 ### and then your wife calls and hi honey leave me a message
2565, 0 ### i'm about to change your life
2568, 0 ### the only downside is that it requires you to know how to text send a text message
2569, 0 ### this is even more amazing
2571, 0 ### which i knew because it's the word that won me the ohio spelling bee in
2573, 0 ### so they attach the audio file at the bottom of the email so you can listen to double check
2574, 0 ### here's the girlfriend
2575, 0 ### this is the i love this the boss call
2579, 0 ### you know how you erase it of course
2580, 0 ### they have every language in the world
2581, 0 ### it's insane right this is pandora
2585, 0 ### really
2586, 0 ### bad sound the signal's weak the software stinks
2587, 0 ### no keys no memory card the sealed you can't replace it
2588, 0 ### i want my friends to look and drool
2590, 1 ### on tory island a strange place anyway they were known as
2591, 1 ### and i wrapped the oven cleaner around the edge of the mop handle and
2592, 1 ### five individual sharks were sampled using simon's shark slime sampling system
2593, 0 ### they're the second largest fish in the world
2594, 0 ### they were very important for the oil out of their liver
2595, 0 ### probably the best documented basking shark fishery in the world is that from island
2596, 1 ### ad hoc peer self configuring wireless networks
2598, 0 ### and i am astounded that i'm standing here to tell you that
2599, 0 ### that is not enough
2600, 1 ### if you say i'm a monkey they immediately know you are either or years old
2601, 1 ### let's have a chat later
2602, 1 ### it's not because they like horses so much it's because they try to avoid having unlucky goat babies
2603, 1 ### they don't look like losers to me
2605, 0 ### over thousands of years this popular culture has affected people's major decisions such as naming marriage giving birth and attitude towards each other
2606, 0 ### in the year of the dragon the birthrate in china hong kong and taiwan increased by five percent
2607, 0 ### so maybe we should consider maybe it's much better to have less competition
2608, 1 ### and i think the reason this image works again is because frieda is driving the bulldozer
2609, 1 ### so the don't really like me because it doesn't matter if kate moss is wearing it or if i'm wearing it it looks the same
2610, 1 ### and should that pig have grown unfortunately it was dead it would have certainly been dead after i x rayed it with the amount of radiation i used anyway
2611, 1 ### it weighs kilograms and the only exercise i get is opening and closing it
2612, 1 ### and i sent them back an x ray
2613, 1 ### so i like to use them
2614, 0 ### i'm interpreting it in a more contemporary manner
2615, 0 ### it's actually the same person
2616, 0 ### the design comes from within
2617, 0 ### and i'm sure those architects are inspired as i am by what surrounds us by nature
2618, 0 ### and i use that sort of technology to create things that are quite beautiful
2619, 0 ### still has the tag in it from me buying it so i can take it back to the shop if she didn't like it
2620, 1 ### i do actually feel more alien the longer i live there
2621, 1 ### they move to new york city
2622, 1 ### you all know that crazy system six days in hell you get the seventh day free
2623, 0 ### so i don't think i've really earned the right to call myself an indian
2624, 0 ### and they have one home associated with their parents but another associated with their partners a third connected maybe with the place where they happen to be a fourth connected with the place they dream of being and many more besides
2625, 0 ### and i'd always felt this way but it really came home to me as it were some years ago when i was climbing up the stairs in my parents' house in california and i looked through the living room windows and i saw that we were encircled by flames one of those wildfires that regularly tear through the hills of california and many other such places
2626, 1 ### and now because live demos are always a bad idea we're going to try a live demo
2628, 1 ### this brutal pragmatism that she had i mean i was four and she told me mommy is santa
2630, 1 ### so why am i here talking to all of you well i guess i am a lifelong troublemaker and when my parents taught my twin brother and i to question authority i don't think they knew where it might lead
2632, 1 ### and perhaps because of its size a group of people all by the way with y chromosomes decided they would want to sequence it
2633, 1 ### that's the equivalent of you filling up your car with gas in waiting until and now you can drive to jupiter and back twice
2634, 1 ### and after nine months of grueling recovery he's now eating steak with sauce
2635, 1 ### and we had indeed the entire dot com bubble
2636, 1 ### not to worry though that was quickly rescued by the and indeed angry birds
2638, 1 ### personalized massage anyone there's already a lab today that tests for allele of the gene the so called cheating gene
2639, 1 ### who's here today with your significant other just turn over to them swab their mouth send it to the lab and you'll know for sure
2643, 0 ### so now what we do is take a genome we make maybe copies of it we cut all those copies up into little reads and then we sequence them massively parallel
2644, 0 ### in fact there's one lab in particular that represents percent of all that capacity it's called the beijing institute
2646, 0 ### if you have this deleterious mutation in this gene you're percent likely to get cancer in your life
2647, 0 ### and so they were given l dopa and their symptoms did improve but they weren't totally asymptomatic
2649, 0 ### so a hundred surgeries later he looks at his mom and says mom please pray for me
2650, 0 ### so it turns out that the very same technology is also being used to grow new lines of corn wheat soybean and other crops that are highly tolerant of drought of flood of pests and pesticides
2651, 0 ### so my father's father was one of resnick brothers
2652, 1 ### what the guy actually meant was that he'd fed a dose of to his dog that morning
2654, 1 ### and these are the things that get him through his day
2655, 1 ### we were very proud of this particularly the title which was as centrifuge
2656, 1 ### and we're not going to publish it because we only publish science
2659, 0 ### the second is basically an entrepreneur who is set up and doing who at a table in a market
2661, 0 ### and paper of course wicks fluid as you know paper cloth drop wine on the tablecloth and the wine wicks all over everything
2662, 0 ### so this is an example of a device made from a simple piece of paper
2663, 0 ### the second is you can put lots and lots of tests in a very small place
2664, 1 ### obviously the best way to divulge a secret is to tell someone to not say anything about it
2667, 1 ### um yes
2672, 0 ### witness please eugene shoemaker who diligently from a young boy decided he wanted to make maps of celestial bodies
2674, 0 ### they are the nodes on the string patterns and relationships
2676, 1 ### but it was a fairly abstract discussion and at some point when there was a pause octavio said paul maybe we could watch the
2677, 0 ### so we could easily supply the world with dozens maybe hundreds of new cities
2679, 1 ### he says technology is anything that was invented after you were born
2680, 1 ### danny hillis actually has an update on that he says technology is anything that doesn't quite work yet
2682, 0 ### and i'm this morning going to talk about this for the first time
2683, 0 ### and the trick that richard dawkins does which is to say to look at them as simply as genes as vehicles for genes
2689, 1 ### unlike bill gates i'm not going to release them
2691, 0 ### this year alone with the support of our community we are planning to ship a million microscopes to kids around the world
2693, 0 ### also there a billion kids on this planet that live in poverty
2695, 1 ### he was not just a scientist he had a in molecular biology
2696, 1 ### the first one judge lourie made up his own novel biological theory totally wrong
2697, 1 ### also in the room were three leaders of the human genome project including the co discoverer of himself james watson who had submitted a brief to the court where he referred to gene patenting as lunacy
2698, 1 ### and in one of my absolutely favorite moments justice sotomayor proclaimed isolated to be just nature sitting there
2699, 1 ### i opened it up to find a small stuffed animal
2700, 0 ### i explained to chris that i was feeling a little bit stuck
2703, 0 ### allowing patent holders often private companies to lock up stretches of the human genome was harming patients
2704, 0 ### gene patents clearly were a problem and were harming patients
2705, 0 ### as we delved into this issue we traveled all over the country to speak with many different experts scientists medical professionals lawyers patent lawyers
2706, 1 ### here is the orange one
2707, 1 ### and here is the gray one
2710, 1 ### we're going to look at it for about seconds which is a bit of a killer in an talk
2712, 1 ### then you can little numbers on them
2713, 1 ### and she'll come into the hive find an empty honey pot and throw up and that's honey
2714, 1 ### so thank you very much
2715, 0 ### and you have to tell me which one
2716, 0 ### so color enables us to see the similarities and differences between surfaces according to the full spectrum of light that they reflect
2718, 0 ### the one on the right comes from a yellow surface in shadow oriented facing the left viewed through a pinkish medium
2719, 0 ### there's no inherent meaning in information
2722, 0 ### so if i could have the lights down up here
2723, 0 ### that's your new normal
2726, 1 ### of course
2728, 1 ### he has become a bit of a media star because he goes to the film openings and he knows how to work an audience now
2733, 0 ### aspirations are rising as never before because of access to the internet
2734, 0 ### my father too was a refugee
2735, 0 ### and at the time the aspirations of the world bank group the organization i lead now were extremely low for korea
2736, 0 ### first we went to dallas
2738, 1 ### and you control their thinking not like this although that would be cool
2739, 1 ### it's hard for me to admit to you because i'm a pricing consultant
2740, 0 ### it's true if you're a business owner if you're an employee if you're a job seeker
2741, 0 ### in my work i've often heard women express that they're uncomfortable communicating their value especially early on in business ownership
2742, 1 ### one interesting thing that came out of this this is an app for called the eatery is that we think our pizza is significantly healthier than other people's pizza is
2743, 1 ### i have particularly high bad cholesterol and i have some bad liver numbers but those are because we had a dinner party with a lot of good wine the night before we ran the test
2744, 1 ### it's not the most science positive state in the united states of america
2745, 1 ### you do have to solve a as well
2748, 0 ### he thought yellow fever was not transmitted by dirty clothing
2749, 0 ### so some of the people in some of the tents had dirty clothes and some of the people were in tents that were full of mosquitos that had been exposed to yellow fever
2750, 1 ### i've swum in that river
2751, 1 ### your aunt she's friends with his wife
2753, 1 ### then to my tremendous relief i was freaking out to be honest with you a smile began to snake across his face and he just laughed
2755, 1 ### so they're losing power losing power until finally they get to a point where hot water goes into their mouths and they cook from the inside out
2758, 0 ### it sounded like ocean waves constantly crashing and as we got closer i saw smoke vapor coming up through the trees
2759, 0 ### pouring rain couldn't see a thing
2762, 1 ### okay now this gives one a little pause
2763, 1 ### but every once in a while like lizzie borden like three times a century and we're kind of due
2764, 1 ### but more likely is this
2765, 1 ### so what we've done is i've started to do pet scans of everybody in the family
2766, 1 ### so that's my talk
2767, 0 ### and so this would be the typical talk i would give
2768, 0 ### so i've looked at about of these
2769, 0 ### you get different kinds of psychopaths
2770, 0 ### and there is a variant of this gene that is in the normal population
2771, 0 ### but for a son he can only get the x chromosome from his mother
2772, 1 ### to which you have to say that's true but i think we should focus right now on what to have for breakfast
2777, 1 ### my favorite of the letters that i got was the one that came from a woman who wrote and said that she had tried therapy medication she had tried pretty much everything and she had found a solution and hoped i would tell the world and that was making little things from yarn
2780, 1 ### instead what they did was they took people one at a time into dingy little rooms and had them talk for an hour about bad things that had happened to them
2782, 1 ### and i said the fact that you've never heard of it is an indication that it is news
2783, 1 ### and maggie robbins said i used to volunteer in an aids clinic and i would just talk and talk and talk and the people i was dealing with weren't very responsive and i thought not very friendly or helpful of them
2784, 0 ### in i had a series of losses
2787, 0 ### and finally after four full hours of my lying and staring at it the phone rang and somehow i managed to pick it up and it was my father and i said i'm in serious trouble
2788, 0 ### the first is that i knew that objectively speaking i had a nice life and that if i could only get well there was something at the other end that was worth living for
2790, 0 ### i hope that years hence people will hear about my treatments and be appalled that anyone endured such primitive science
2791, 0 ### if you experience a catastrophic loss and you feel terrible and six months later you can barely function at all then it's probably a depression that was triggered by the catastrophic circumstances
2794, 0 ### it's easier to help who perceive that there's something foreign inside of them that needs to be but it's difficult with because we believe we are seeing the truth
2795, 0 ### things are different because now i know that depression is the family secret that everyone has
2796, 1 ### so by now my talk is already words long and i feel like i should stop here
2798, 1 ### let me now turn to the last project which involves the national beverage of scotland
2799, 1 ### and now let's set that on fire
2800, 0 ### if you look at science on one hand science is a very rational approach to its surroundings whereas art on the other hand is usually an emotional approach to its surroundings
2802, 0 ### i agree it looks pretty amazing
2803, 0 ### now i've got a live demonstration over here to show this to you
2805, 1 ### there is not really much of an indication in fact that there is a person on board
2806, 1 ### and if you did he'd probably be from sao paulo
2807, 1 ### it will be a long time before they really understand it
2808, 0 ### and those relationships can in fact be constructed in hundreds of thousands potentially millions of ways
2809, 0 ### in an adult brain of course we've built up a large repertoire of mastered skills and abilities that we can perform more or less automatically from memory and that define us as acting moving thinking creatures
2810, 0 ### the first great epoch is commonly called the critical period
2812, 1 ### they blew up
2814, 1 ### when they fly into our bedroom at night they prefer to bite my wife
2818, 1 ### here in this box i have a cage with several hundred hungry female mosquitoes
2821, 1 ### we kill them
2825, 0 ### one of the best ways of killing mosquitoes is not to wait until they fly around like adults and bite people and transmit disease
2827, 0 ### and so we set up another crazy experiment because we collected the smell of these larvae put it on pieces of cloth and then did something very remarkable
2829, 0 ### have a look
2834, 1 ### and in these instances the poem would come up on the page perfect and intact but backwards from the last word to the first
2835, 1 ### so when i heard that i was like that's uncanny that's exactly what my creative process is like
2837, 1 ### and i would please like the record to reflect today that i showed up for my part of the job
2838, 0 ### and the peculiar thing is that i recently wrote this book this memoir called eat pray love which decidedly unlike any of my previous books went out in the world for some reason and became this big mega sensation international bestseller thing
2841, 0 ### and i definitely know that in my case in my situation it would be very dangerous for me to start sort of leaking down that dark path of assumption particularly given the circumstance that i'm in right now in my career
2843, 0 ### which is great because the romans did not actually think that a genius was a particularly clever individual
2844, 0 ### you know i think that allowing somebody one mere person to believe that he or she is like the vessel you know like the font and the essence and the source of all divine creative unknowable eternal mystery is just a too much responsibility to put on one fragile human psyche
2846, 1 ### if you look at these two eye contact facing each other possibly both talking at the same time
2847, 0 ### one definition of health may be that that chord is in complete harmony
2849, 1 ### it's the only place you ever go for a walk in the woods and all the trees are lined up in rows
2851, 1 ### fact is there's a general rule if you don't like it it's fake if you do like it it's faux
2852, 1 ### it's not really the magic kingdom
2854, 1 ### right if you could check into the ads you'd have a great experience
2856, 0 ### so we moved from an industrial economy to a service based economy
2857, 0 ### so we're shifting to an experience economy where experiences are becoming the predominant economic offering
2858, 0 ### think about ted itself
2859, 0 ### they say you americans
2862, 1 ### couples like this one and this one and this one and yes even this one
2864, 0 ### but for an idea that is so broadly accepted in private birth control certainly generates a lot of opposition in public
2866, 1 ### but i'm slowing down in this video by a factor of billion so you can see the light in motion
2870, 1 ### so in the future when this camera is in your camera phone you might be able to go to a supermarket and check if the fruit is ripe without actually touching it
2871, 0 ### and that packet of photons that bullet will travel at the speed of light and again a million times faster than an ordinary bullet
2873, 0 ### on the left you see our camera
2875, 0 ### and i realized that all the gigabytes of data that we're collecting every time are not just for scientific imaging
2878, 1 ### i was raised by lesbians in the mountains and i sort of came like a forest to new york city a while back
2879, 1 ### it was some good shit man
2880, 1 ### well that's the blood fountain
2881, 1 ### this is a bird god tied up to a battleship
2882, 1 ### anyway her tail catches on fire from the back of the volcano
2883, 1 ### way ahead of their time
2884, 0 ### now at some point i was in hawaii i like to hike and surf and do all that weird stuff and i was making a collage for my ma
2886, 0 ### i started drawing on the layers of glass almost like if you drew on a window then you put another window and another window and you had all these windows together that made a three dimensional composition
2887, 0 ### so the triptych
2888, 0 ### they're like cells they come together they divide
2889, 0 ### i'll take you quickly through these works because i can't explain them for too long
2890, 1 ### the first thing i did upon awakening from that last surgery was to climb out of my crib and begin wandering around the intensive care nursery probably looking for the one who did this to me
2892, 1 ### it will keep me for example from making an undignified departure from the stage
2893, 1 ### this will take a while
2894, 1 ### okay anyone with your hands still up has challenges of your own
2895, 1 ### so and the feedback for the p
2896, 1 ### you do not know the power of the dark side
2897, 1 ### you'd all make great blind people
2898, 0 ### i call this process flash sonar
2900, 0 ### i'm going to hold this panel in front of me but i'm not going to move it
2901, 0 ### yes that's amazing
2907, 1 ### i've been working with filmmakers on a feature length slime mold documentary and i stress feature length which is in the final stages of edit and will be hitting your cinema screens very soon
2908, 0 ### in its natural habitat you might find the slime mold foraging in woodlands eating rotting vegetation but you might equally find it in research laboratories classrooms and even artists' studios
2910, 1 ### but then they'd remember that you're but a mere human of ordinary mortal intelligence that didn't finish university and they'd kind of forgive you and pet you like the dog
2913, 0 ### decks
2914, 1 ### i cringe though when i'm referred to as a finger painter
2915, 1 ### on average a piece this size takes me about as you can see seconds
2916, 0 ### if you can experience the of these landscapes perhaps you'll be inspired to protect and preserve them
2917, 0 ### we rode camels in northern africa and on dog sleds near the north pole
2918, 1 ### and that's one of the reasons why i think many of you here will be on the dark net fairly soon
2919, 1 ### but let's say for a moment that you were
2920, 1 ### there is even most beautifully of all a report this item button
2921, 1 ### it's the user reviews
2922, 1 ### i would too if i were you
2924, 1 ### hundreds of people send their into one address they're tumbled and jumbled up and then the right amount is sent on to the right recipients but they're different micro laundering systems
2925, 1 ### you can even buy some advertising space
2926, 1 ### one vendor will offer you fair trade organic cocaine
2927, 1 ### they even promised to reinvest percent of any profits into local education programs
2929, 0 ### was offering excellent and consistent marijuana at a reasonable price
2930, 0 ### and by my reckoning that is not a good thing
2931, 0 ### you don't pay with your credit card of course that would lead directly back to you
2932, 0 ### brilliant elegant
2933, 0 ### and i think things like the dark net markets creative secure difficult to censor i think that's the future
2934, 0 ### there are now between two and three million daily users of the tor browser the majority of which use is perfectly legitimate sometimes even mundane
2935, 0 ### another called twister and so on and so on
2936, 0 ### has started a dark net site
2937, 0 ### it's also good news if you want to browse for illegal pornography and if you want to buy and sell drugs with impunity
2938, 1 ### he came out for one of our teacher training days and won like five rounds of match me in a row and was very proud of himself
2939, 0 ### and it's very flat
2940, 1 ### and there's few things more thrilling than playing a song for the first time in front of an audience especially when it's half finished
2941, 1 ### and i'm going to demonstrate for you
2943, 0 ### because although i've used scientific terms in songs it's very difficult sometimes to make them lyrical
2944, 0 ### all right
2947, 1 ### so we can build
2948, 1 ### and even animals like these donkeys love our buildings
2949, 1 ### it is simply how we protect our walls
2950, 1 ### i'm still alive
2953, 0 ### people still are dying in burkina faso and access to clean drinking water is still a big problem
2954, 0 ### from my home village in burkina faso to berlin in germany to become an architect is a big big step
2956, 0 ### i started to speak with the community and i could convince everybody and we could start to work
2957, 0 ### don't forget it can be degrees in burkina faso so with simple ventilation i wanted to make the classroom good for teaching and learning
2959, 1 ### i just say that to encourage transparency so you can be seated
2961, 0 ### i've done it to women's rights organizations
2962, 1 ### i sell drugs guns porno with kids vodka water
2963, 1 ### he hides his sensitivities and romantic side because in russia among guys that's not cool to be romantic but it's cool to be surrounded with women and look like an aggressive hulk
2964, 0 ### i took the painting and gifted new contemporary meaning talking about issues which are surrounding me in russia capturing people who are non models but have an interesting story
2965, 0 ### for russian society i'm an old maid and hopeless to ever get married
2967, 1 ### being gay and fathering triplets is by far the most socially innovative socially entrepreneurial thing i have ever done
2969, 1 ### our generation does not want its epitaph to read we kept charity overhead low
2970, 0 ### and i do believe that business will move the great mass of humanity forward
2973, 0 ### we'll put you on the cover of wired magazine
2974, 1 ### for me it's a goal by lionel
2975, 1 ### or lots of masks
2976, 1 ### and when i asked the woman who had designed this experience why it worked she simply said never underestimate the power of a ridiculous wig
2978, 1 ### based on the promises of positive psychology we speak of play and and one start up even says that when someone gets fired they have graduated
2979, 0 ### but there is something else that was remarkable about it
2980, 0 ### and to unify these immensely different cultures we were going to launch a third new brand
2982, 0 ### create intimacy studies show that how we feel about our workplace very much depends on the relationships with our coworkers
2984, 1 ### for me today on this date it's like a second bar mitzvah experience
2985, 1 ### so this is i think the first kosher hippocratic surgical system
2986, 0 ### it is transparent made just for you
2987, 0 ### okay when you hear the click this is when the energy starts to emit and you see a little lesion form inside the phantom
2988, 1 ### he said you can't wake a person who's pretending to sleep
2989, 0 ### i was going to work on international development and then i took a turn and ended up here
2990, 1 ### i never thought i'd be quoting boxer mike tyson on the ted stage but he once said everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face
2992, 1 ### my entire life either at the schoolhouse on the way to the schoolhouse or talking about what happens in the schoolhouse
2993, 1 ### well i said to her you know kids don't learn from people they don't like
2995, 1 ### i'm not real good with math but i was working on it
2996, 1 ### i'd taught the whole lesson wrong
2998, 0 ### for years i have watched people teach
2999, 0 ### i have had classes that were so low so academically deficient that i cried
3000, 0 ### we teach anyway because that's what we do
3001, 0 ### but it is not impossible
3002, 1 ### and i thought maybe i can be a reporter and doctor gynecologist
3003, 0 ### and they are in our backyard
3004, 1 ### encouraging yes
3005, 1 ### so you're looking now at an actual image of dark matter
3008, 0 ### it's kind of a magic place the mountain
3009, 0 ### it's no exaggeration to say that the southern hemisphere is going to be the future of astronomy for the century
3010, 0 ### there'll be a satellite called tess that will discover planets outside of our solar system
3014, 1 ### the first lesson for successful life everyone is this choose your parents very carefully
3019, 0 ### and it's also the one that spoke to me personally because it's about how to use science to do the best for our children
3020, 1 ### so right now i feel more like these are my principles and if you don't like them i have others
3021, 0 ### you can see my fellow riders at the end of the picture looking at me with some concern
3022, 1 ### he was interested in productivity i think it's something that concerns all of us but it's easy to measure in chickens because you just count the eggs
3023, 1 ### they'd the rest to death
3024, 1 ### now as i've gone around the world talking about this and telling this story in all sorts of organizations and companies people have seen the relevance almost instantly and they come up and they say things to me like that that's my company
3026, 1 ### and when i reflected on my own career and the extraordinary people i've had the privilege to work with i realized how much more we could give each other if we just stopped trying to be
3027, 0 ### we've thought that success is achieved by picking the superstars the brightest men or occasionally women in the room and giving them all the resources and all the power
3028, 0 ### and what happened was exactly what you'd expect that some groups were very much more successful than others but what was really interesting was that the high achieving groups were not those where they had one or two people with spectacularly high i
3029, 0 ### and thirdly the more successful groups had more women in them
3030, 0 ### at sap they reckon that you can answer any question in minutes
3032, 1 ### i don't know where she read that publication
3033, 1 ### i was a black angry woman
3034, 1 ### and i thought her definition of empowerment was very strange
3037, 1 ### apparently white men have a problem finding the clitoris
3041, 0 ### he was looking for a heart attack that's what i say
3042, 0 ### stay away from it
3043, 0 ### she put us in a car and we drove for hours and ended up in a bush in a remote area in gambia
3044, 0 ### i don't know what's going on
3045, 0 ### she took hold of what i now know to be my clitoris she took that rusty knife and started cutting away inch by inch
3046, 1 ### the big discoveries are all behind us
3047, 0 ### then the internet revolution brought us computing power data networks unprecedented access to information and communication and our lives have never been the same
3048, 1 ### come back start again
3049, 1 ### and then we thought we'd help america because america's been helping everyone whether they want help or not
3050, 1 ### and the hotel gave us the ballroom for it very appropriate room
3051, 1 ### and i thought a hotdog will be more symbolic
3052, 1 ### come over and i'll do the whole lot of you
3053, 1 ### in every country every program you need a symbol and this is probably the best thing he's ever done with his
3055, 1 ### and then new change we had hair bands clothing and the condom for your mobile phone during the rainy season
3056, 1 ### but let me warn you these are thai sized so be very careful
3058, 1 ### and these are our thai tulips
3059, 0 ### so the first step get to the children get to the mothers and then follow up with family planning
3060, 0 ### so we said let's do it
3061, 0 ### no we decided to do a bit more
3062, 0 ### so there we are
3063, 0 ### so some of the monks in the villages were doing the same thing themselves
3064, 0 ### over a quarter of a million were taught about family planning with a new alphabet a b for birth c for condom i for v for vasectomy
3065, 0 ### if you're pregnant take care of your pregnancy
3068, 0 ### and then we got a new prime minister soon after that
3069, 0 ### and we gave every station half a minute extra for advertising to earn more money
3070, 1 ### it's by gal stripping that tissue we humanize it and then we can put it back into a patient's knee
3072, 0 ### so with that let me just show you a quick video to get you in the mood of what we're trying to explain
3074, 1 ### she said everything is fine but once i spent a whole night asking and trying to translate the meaning of the word for him
3075, 1 ### the poor woman tried to translate this for him from them i extended my hands and stole you and here's the pickle and because you belong to them i returned my hands and left you
3078, 0 ### he replied don't you know what they call it i do
3080, 1 ### in fact it looked like the appian way marble salesman showed up with his sample book showed it to hadrian and hadrian said we'll take all of it
3081, 1 ### for the first time i realized people were smart years ago
3082, 0 ### he was one of the new york school abstract who together with his contemporaries invented american modern art and contributed to moving the american zeitgeist towards modernism in the century
3083, 0 ### i followed the path of most kids who are genetically programmed to make their parents crazy
3084, 1 ### the tasmanian devil got its name from the terrifying nocturnal scream that it makes
3086, 0 ### and in fact there's concern that the species could go extinct in the wild within to years
3087, 0 ### now there's only a small part of the population which remains unaffected
3092, 1 ### massive attack most people cannot play them that way
3093, 0 ### she was peeling this palm frond apart these little threads off of it and she'd roll the threads together and make little thicker threads like strings and she would weave the strings together and as the materiality of this exact very bag formed before my eyes over those three days the materiality of the way the world works of reality kind of started to unravel in my mind because i realized that this bag and these clothes and the trampoline you have at home and the pencil everything you have is made out of either a tree or a rock or something we dug out of the ground and did some process to maybe a more complicated one but still everything was made that way
3094, 0 ### i was at mit media lab and i was studying the maker movement and makers and creativity
3097, 0 ### i'm going to give you some building blocks and they're cactus building blocks so it's totally legit
3098, 1 ### however you pick them up and underneath actually engraved in the metal are the words stolen from virgin atlantic airways upper class
3099, 1 ### what is completely lacking is a class of people who have immense amounts of power but no money at all
3101, 1 ### moving over we come of course to consultancy
3103, 0 ### so there seems to be a complete disconnect here
3105, 0 ### it actually says garage funk rhythm and blues
3106, 0 ### and she came across a similar example of something that fascinated me as being something which in a business context or a government context would simply be so trivial a solution as to seem embarrassing
3109, 1 ### don't get me started on that
3110, 1 ### even thomas friedman supported the war
3112, 1 ### so that's what i have to say
3114, 0 ### sometimes it works
3116, 0 ### william faulkner drunk and depressed
3117, 0 ### orson welles peaked at twenty five below before our eyes
3118, 1 ### are there some rules we can develop for changing rules i want to argue that there is a general abstract insight that we can make practical which is that if we can give more choices to people and more choices to leaders who in many countries are also people
3119, 1 ### so what will it take to get started building the first charter cities scaling this so we build many more it would help to have a manual
3121, 0 ### let's give him a name too nelson
3123, 0 ### and he says that if you want to see the damaging effects of rules the ways that rules can keep people in the dark look at the pictures from nasa of the earth at night
3125, 1 ### in other words we want to leave the option open for there being a giant elephant at the center of our galaxy
3127, 0 ### i do research in a computer science lab that works on making computers see through images and video
3128, 1 ### no just joking
3129, 0 ### i don't give a damn about the revolution
3131, 1 ### i sell dreams and i peddle love to millions of people back home in india who assume that i'm the best lover in the world
3132, 1 ### if you don't tell anyone i'm going to tell you i'm not but i never let that assumption go away
3135, 1 ### naturally it follows i'm going to speak about the present me
3140, 0 ### you went wherever life took you for work and people were mostly welcoming of you
3143, 0 ### everything i did good bad ugly was there for the world to comment upon and judge
3146, 0 ### it will perish in its own self absorption
3150, 1 ### mather i just have to get through the initial days where i don't get eliminated
3151, 1 ### i like it
3152, 0 ### i've explored experienced and experimented enterprise and capitalism to my heart's content
3153, 0 ### the service which grew out of this dial for ambulance with one ambulance in now has a hundred plus ambulances in three states and has transported over patients and victims since inception
3155, 1 ### it's all figure
3156, 1 ### it's sort of a visual canon
3157, 0 ### i have a monthly puzzle calendar
3158, 0 ### i'll have him cut out letters out of construction paper for the board
3160, 1 ### if this does not blow your mind then you have no emotion
3161, 1 ### they told me that they preferred me on than in person
3162, 1 ### someone wrote it on it was a comment first time i smiled doing a derivative
3163, 1 ### this person did a derivative and then they smiled
3164, 1 ### i actually got a natural high and a good mood for the entire day since i remember seeing all of this matrix text in class and here i'm all like know kung fu
3165, 1 ### and so you can imagine here i was an analyst at a hedge fund it was very strange for me to do something of social value
3166, 1 ### if isaac newton had done videos on calculus i wouldn't have to
3170, 1 ### just the wording of the or how many points you get for doing something we see on a system wide basis like tens of thousands of fifth graders or sixth graders going one direction or another depending what badge you give them
3172, 1 ### we've got a million people on the site already so we can handle a few more
3173, 0 ### notice this is an and it's an alcohol
3174, 0 ### they can just watch those videos if they're bored they can go ahead
3175, 0 ### you've given the lectures so now what we do and this could happen in every classroom in america tomorrow what i do is i assign the lectures for homework and what used to be homework i now have the students doing in the classroom
3178, 0 ### then you build on that in the next concept
3179, 0 ### do it as long as necessary until you have mastery
3180, 0 ### this is shifting and reflecting functions
3182, 0 ### but what we want to do is use the natural conclusion of the flipping of the classroom that those early teachers had emailed me about
3183, 0 ### every row is a student
3185, 0 ### it's almost like you can see them learning over those last problems
3187, 1 ### as you remember the apple did nothing at all
3188, 1 ### and the floppy disk drive person wears it
3189, 1 ### that's a bus really
3192, 1 ### or fear like this kind of a nightclub typeface
3194, 1 ### and i can add in a blue and a dove and i have like don draper free
3195, 1 ### it's not clear
3196, 1 ### it's peaceful like that
3197, 1 ### it's kind of stressful typing out so if you type on this keyboard you can like balance it out
3198, 1 ### that means art is working you know it's like art is supposed to be enigmatic so when you say like i don't get it like oh that's great
3199, 1 ### and the shopkeeper would say it's old
3200, 1 ### oh it's really old
3201, 1 ### and also no love
3202, 0 ### i made a computer out of people
3203, 0 ### it could show text and after we waited a bit we had these things called images
3206, 0 ### and then i spent a lot of time in the space of interactive graphics and things like this and i stopped doing it because my students at mit got so much better than myself so i had to hang up my mouse
3207, 0 ### ten variations
3208, 0 ### at you're not allowed to draw from an image
3210, 0 ### we aren't a simple authoritarian regime anymore
3211, 0 ### and that's kind of awkward
3212, 0 ### and this frame is important today in this complex ambiguous space and artists and designers have a lot to teach us i believe
3213, 0 ### i was like oh this my job
3214, 0 ### let me show you something i haven't shown anywhere actually
3215, 0 ### for instance green are areas doing well red are areas doing poorly
3217, 0 ### and i believe that this kind of perspective will only begin to grow as more leaders enter the space of art and design because art and design lets you think like this find different systems like this and i've just begun thinking like this so i'm glad to share that with you
3219, 1 ### i know these are tough and you may have a hard time getting your hand bent around it but this is actually critical
3220, 1 ### so here you go
3221, 1 ### if you had the right information you would have done the right thing
3223, 0 ### face to face would work but it's hard to set it up
3224, 0 ### now when you approach these animals you need to understand there's a dangerous end to them and you also need to approach them with some level of respect and a little bit of wariness
3226, 1 ### one of you probably has alzheimer's disease
3228, 1 ### let's say you're there's alzheimer's in your family so you've likely inherited a gene or two that tips your scale arm a bit you've been burning the candle at both ends for years you love bacon and you don't run unless someone's chasing you
3230, 0 ### and the is where alzheimer's happens
3234, 1 ### there was so many skeptics especially the press in london that they started flying cheeseburgers on helicopters around my box to tempt me
3235, 1 ### so i took that as a challenge basically
3237, 1 ### so that clearly wasn't going to work
3238, 1 ### then i thought about the craziest idea of all the ideas to actually do it
3239, 1 ### we'll say big boned
3241, 1 ### i wanted to try it in the most extreme situations to see if i could slow my heart rate down under duress
3242, 1 ### two days before my big breath hold attempt for the record the producers of my television special thought that just watching somebody holding their breath and almost drowning is too boring for television
3243, 1 ### i had failed on every level
3244, 1 ### so naturally the only way out of the slump that i could think of was i decided to call oprah
3245, 1 ### i realized that my real competition was the beaver
3246, 0 ### the next one is i froze myself in a block of ice for three days and three nights in new york city
3247, 0 ### by the time i was a teenager i was able to hold my breath for three minutes and seconds
3248, 0 ### there is many different aspects to free diving
3249, 0 ### so i learned never to move
3250, 0 ### and you're really ridding your body of
3251, 0 ### i would repeat this process eight times in a row
3253, 0 ### every morning again after getting out of that tent your brain is completely wiped out
3254, 0 ### i completely trained to get my breath hold time up for what i needed to do
3255, 0 ### it would stop
3256, 0 ### but i was just floating there waiting for my heart to stop just waiting
3258, 1 ### it was terribly dangerous
3259, 0 ### i'm going to tell you about that technology
3260, 1 ### so back in november during the election last year the only image that we could publish was this which was on the stand on the week that everybody voted
3263, 0 ### and in the library i found the images that really captured the zeitgeist of the great depression
3266, 1 ### it was a bit like being in a hotel but with very food
3267, 0 ### but for mary this meeting is different
3270, 1 ### i thought i was famous enough that i would raise the money within one month but i've been humbled
3271, 1 ### i don't know how they did it
3272, 0 ### and also the easiest one was when i was doing it in form of a music
3273, 0 ### keep on going
3274, 1 ### i see a lot of very blank faces
3276, 1 ### and before we know it right we're anxious about feeling anxious
3278, 0 ### every time i sort of pushed one down another one would pop back up again
3279, 0 ### so i quit my degree i headed off to the himalayas i became a monk and i started studying meditation
3281, 1 ### well done never been must go
3282, 1 ### i've never been maybe next year
3283, 1 ### my country the united kingdom is sort of middling sort of dull but who cares at least we beat the french
3284, 1 ### contrary to the way we sometimes talk about it was not handed down from god on tablets of stone
3286, 0 ### economy was plummeting into the great depression and policy makers were struggling to respond
3287, 0 ### but in that first report kuznets himself delivered a warning
3288, 0 ### but we have ignored warning
3289, 0 ### it counts bombs and prisons as progress
3290, 1 ### and i'll never forget the day i was called in by a member of top management and told to stop associating with any known or suspected environmentalists
3291, 0 ### i literally grew up with the ford motor company
3293, 1 ### now hand your unlocked phone to the person on your left
3299, 1 ### let me read you his review
3302, 0 ### so i invite him out for a beer and he tells me all about his passion for making a difference in the world
3308, 0 ### now here's a discovery we made just last week
3312, 1 ### to me the irony about the story is hearing about the engineers who had bought cheap small electronic calculators in japan that they used to double check their calculators
3314, 1 ### and the parts are all numbered and basically what you end up with is a really big ikea kit
3315, 0 ### and a couple of things struck me about this
3317, 1 ### and he slashed so many budgets that people said they couldn't afford paintings anymore and they needed to have their portrait a la silhouette
3318, 1 ### so the spelling spider is a cousin of the spelling bee
3319, 1 ### i have some stories that are humorous like dead beats
3320, 1 ### so it's actually a that's nine yards long
3321, 1 ### and i still feel i'm running it's just the training to become a long distance
3322, 1 ### because if you sit a long time in summer in shorts you will walk away with temporary branding of the story element on your thighs
3323, 0 ### i was not born with a blade in my hand
3325, 0 ### and i have a passion for images and for words
3326, 0 ### so scrolls are very convenient because you can create a large image on a very small table
3327, 0 ### so each window is an image and is a world that i often revisit
3328, 0 ### so sometimes i view from the inside like and the inner circles
3329, 0 ### people tell me their lives their memories their aspirations and i create a
3330, 1 ### in peru they call it the peruvian because the becomes so integrated into our traditions that if someone asks people from each place are completely convinced that the was invented in their country
3332, 1 ### and to tell you the truth i didn't really know what to say
3333, 1 ### i gave him a hug and left but
3335, 0 ### i was getting up to leave and go home to write when stopped me and said hang on hang on and presented me with this challenge write the stanzas for this song in
3336, 0 ### and listen to this coincidence he was the same guy who added the sixth string to what would later be called the spanish guitar
3337, 0 ### and me imagine me trying to write in
3338, 1 ### and the good news this one's a monster
3339, 0 ### there are many science based analyses of this but they all draw the same conclusion that we're living beyond our means
3340, 1 ### in the planet would find it complex and confusing and my little dog watson would find it simple and understandable but would miss the point
3342, 0 ### we go to magic shows in order to be fooled
3344, 1 ### some of you may want the toilet paper with the most bleach in it rather than the most ecologically responsible choice
3345, 1 ### reading the newspaper it never has to be outdated
3346, 1 ### this is a more controversial one
3348, 0 ### so we don't really have easy access to all this relevant information that can just help us make optimal decisions about what to do next and what actions to take
3349, 0 ### and we see how this system lets him walk up to any surface and start using his hands to interact with the information that is projected in front of him
3351, 0 ### and his girlfriend is probably not very happy about him either
3352, 1 ### pictures like this people perched on a fire hydrant not the mark of a world class city
3354, 1 ### one brooklyn paper called this bike lane that we have on prospect park west the most contested piece of land outside of the gaza strip
3356, 0 ### you just need to look at them a little differently
3357, 0 ### this is a picture of times square in the and despite all of the technological innovation cultural changes political changes this is times square in
3358, 0 ### three hundred and fifty thousand people a day walk through times square and people had tried for years to make changes
3359, 0 ### and the temporary materials are an important part of the program because we were able to show how it worked
3360, 1 ### it was very difficult actually putting these people in the machine because they were in such bad shape
3361, 1 ### as soon as one guy looks up the other guy will look away
3363, 0 ### after years these two lovers still touch and kiss from their tomb
3364, 1 ### i first heard this when i was a kid and i loved it but i had no idea what it meant
3365, 1 ### lies
3367, 1 ### i was in charge of the four which is good because four can't play sports and neither can i
3369, 1 ### i wanted to live and cross over into that fictional world which is i would always just open people's closet doors
3370, 1 ### there was some other weird stuff that i think my mom should know about
3371, 1 ### and that's what he did
3372, 0 ### and i realized that the stories that i was telling were real in this way that was familiar to me and really exciting
3374, 0 ### it's why in two days people will be descending on dublin to take the walking tour of and see everything that happened in ulysses even though none of that happened
3375, 0 ### pastel
3376, 0 ### it's this little bit of fiction that's colonized the real world
3377, 0 ### right it's when an actor will turn to the audience and say i am an actor these are just rafters
3378, 0 ### nico hello this is nico
3379, 0 ### i actually got nico i hadn't heard from in months and he just left a message two days ago
3380, 1 ### so the following year i decided to go to architecture school
3381, 1 ### recognition seemed to come to those who prioritized novel and sculptural forms like ribbons or
3383, 0 ### my mother was on the line to tell me that doctors had found a lump in his stomach terminal cancer she told me and he had been given only three weeks to live
3384, 0 ### i was surprised to hear a doctor talking about architecture
3386, 1 ### and i want to suggest today that in fact that's wrong
3387, 1 ### one person wrote when i win i'm going to buy my own little mountain and have a little house on top
3388, 1 ### anyone begging for money or trying to extort from me would receive a copy of the picture and nothing else
3389, 1 ### huge effect here of starbucks
3390, 1 ### they basically went out on a date and he says at the end that he didn't achieve her up till now
3391, 1 ### we went to a movie we left early and then went back to her room for
3392, 1 ### i know what you're all thinking about are teams
3393, 0 ### so cnn a little while ago wrote this interesting article on what happens to people when they win the lottery
3395, 0 ### we gave some examples of what you could spend it on
3396, 0 ### it didn't make them less happy it just didn't do much for them
3397, 0 ### they're also fairly wealthy and affluent and other sorts of things
3398, 0 ### we say name a time you spent money on somebody else
3399, 0 ### this isn't it's the local currency
3400, 1 ### i was born and raised near manchester in england but i'm not going to say it in english to you because i'm trying to avoid any assumptions that might be made from my northern accent
3401, 1 ### the only problem with masking it with chinese mandarin is i can only speak this paragraph which i have learned by heart when i was visiting in china
3402, 0 ### actually the only way i feel comfortable wearing it is by pretending they are the robes of a kung fu warrior like li mu from that film crouching tiger hidden dragon
3403, 0 ### this phrase is now etched into my mind clearer than the pin number to my bank card so i can pretend i speak chinese fluently
3404, 1 ### martin luther king would say i imagine a world where all cows will be free to cross the road without having their motives called into question
3405, 1 ### and cow crossed the road and there was much rejoicing as a holy cow
3406, 0 ### so it went on like that and i didn't know where else to find myself
3407, 0 ### so it was good to survive with that little tool that i found to find my own place in school
3408, 1 ### radio
3409, 1 ### and that's me i was going to say holding my first abacus but actually holding what my father would consider an ample substitute to an
3411, 1 ### courage according to churchill is the ability to go from one defeat to another without losing enthusiasm
3412, 1 ### the most important thing is to be a mensch
3413, 0 ### he surrounded himself with an entourage of young unknown scholars like martin and shai and franz kafka and he paid each one of them a monthly salary so that they could write in peace
3414, 0 ### and this is the great team that helped us make it happen
3415, 0 ### and became one of the first massive open online courses although seven years ago we had no idea that what we were doing is called
3417, 0 ### i never worked harder on anything never been challenged to this degree
3418, 1 ### they got two times as much money when they passed go they collected twice the salary and they got to roll both dice instead of one so they got to move around the board a lot more
3419, 1 ### i have three
3423, 1 ### i'm pretty much untouchable at this point
3424, 1 ### and when the rich players talked about why they had inevitably won in this rigged game of monopoly
3425, 1 ### they talked about what they'd done to buy those different properties and earn their success in the game
3427, 0 ### in surveys we've found that it's actually wealthier individuals who are more likely to moralize greed being good and that the pursuit of self interest is favorable and moral
3428, 0 ### participants who felt rich took two times as much candy as participants who felt poor
3430, 0 ### but over the last years that significant difference has become a grand canyon of sorts between those at the top and everyone else
3431, 0 ### there's a lot of really compelling research coming out from top labs all over the world showcasing the range of things that are undermined as economic inequality gets worse
3432, 0 ### but in fact we've been finding in our own laboratory research that small psychological interventions small changes to people's values small nudges in certain directions can restore levels of egalitarianism and empathy
3435, 1 ### and i can see how it might dance
3436, 1 ### snap a little photo of it
3437, 1 ### one of the tools i can eventually earn for my is a monolith that i can drop down
3438, 1 ### ok well maybe they're not worshipping me
3439, 0 ### from that point on everything else was pretty much downhill
3440, 0 ### it was very important
3441, 0 ### and it led me to the study of possible life in the universe
3443, 0 ### so here we are at a very microscopic scale swimming around
3446, 1 ### so we can also eliminate the ugly ones or the caricatures
3447, 1 ### i've made more than portraits myself for newspapers over the course of years sorry years only
3448, 0 ### even this well known portrait is not accepted by many art historians
3449, 0 ### but no faces i find that hard to believe
3450, 1 ### my children usually tell me that one of those passions is a little more apparent than the other
3451, 1 ### now i was growing up in the late and early and there were a number of other passions i was also interested in but these two were the ones that differentiated me
3453, 0 ### and i mean books everywhere around the house
3455, 0 ### that actually for a given body mass of a primate the metabolic rate was static
3458, 0 ### we are legion
3462, 1 ### and carry a bowie knife in my mouth and i'll hunt fish and skin them alive and eat them and maybe drag a desalinization plant behind me for fresh water
3464, 1 ### it is the goal and i should be so shallow to say that this year the destination was even sweeter than the journey
3465, 1 ### and i'm out there kind of tripping out on my little
3467, 0 ### we haven't reached that other shore and still our sense of pride and commitment unwavering commitment
3468, 0 ### but it was deeper
3473, 0 ### thank you very much and enjoy the conference
3474, 1 ### i look at that picture now and i think you did not need a diet you needed a fashion consult
3475, 1 ### now if your mother ever mentioned that life is not fair this is the kind of thing she was talking about
3476, 1 ### so don't do that
3477, 1 ### i left almost all my graphs at home but i couldn't resist throwing in just this one because i'm a geek and that's how i roll
3480, 0 ### you can use lifestyle choices to move your weight up and down within that range but it's much much harder to stay outside of it
3481, 0 ### we would love to think that your brain could tell whether you need to lose weight or not but it can't
3482, 0 ### if you stay at a high weight for too long probably a matter of years for most of us your brain may decide that that's the new normal
3483, 0 ### adding just one healthy habit pulls overweight people back into the normal range
3486, 1 ### this was me running around in the back garden mid summer
3487, 1 ### in ireland the obvious choice is the military but to be honest it actually kind of sucks
3488, 1 ### and that was the finishing post right there
3490, 1 ### so after the sinclair came along the very cleverly named sinclair
3491, 1 ### that was much better
3492, 1 ### this purchase included mining and hunting rights ownership of all land on the island and a castle with no furniture included
3493, 1 ### there's nothing worse than having to listen to someone try and pitch you a really bad video game idea
3494, 1 ### i'm going to stay right here though
3495, 1 ### i just hope she likes video games
3496, 0 ### this is the guy that invented it sir clive sinclair and he's showing his machine
3497, 0 ### this is one of my favorite ones here where they have rabbit breeding so males choose the lucky rabbit
3498, 0 ### he's recognized as being the father of video games in europe
3499, 0 ### by we're going to kick the butt of the music industry
3500, 0 ### and interestingly the people who buy the most games are
3502, 0 ### it's like that guy obviously had some pain while making it
3504, 0 ### we're on this curve and the graphics are getting so ridiculously better
3505, 0 ### the thing again i want you to think about is don't look at these graphics and think of that's the way it is
3509, 1 ### they didn't come so i bought bigger pillows
3511, 0 ### i don't remember the words that she chose to describe genocide to her old daughter but i remember the feeling
3515, 1 ### it also led them to read shorter books
3517, 0 ### in many theme parks you can pay extra to jump to the head of the line
3519, 1 ### for those of you who follow me on i will be out the answer later on today
3523, 0 ### the men that carried that attack out were armed with explosives and hand grenades
3524, 1 ### so i'm specifically interested in how we as humans relate to ourselves each other and the world around us
3525, 1 ### and i called it the muttering hat because it emitted these muttering noises that were kind of tethered to you but you could detach them and share them with somebody else
3526, 1 ### this one is called the talk to yourself hat
3527, 0 ### i can guarantee everyone in this room all of you over there the people in the cushy seats the people up top with the laptops we all have bodies
3528, 0 ### and this has really gotten me thinking about this experience of the initial encounter
3529, 0 ### so beyond that in closing i'd just like to say that we're in this era of communications and device proliferation and it's really tremendous and exciting and sexy but i think what's really important is thinking about how we can simultaneously maintain a sense of wonder and a sense of criticality about the tools that we use and the ways in which we relate to the world
3530, 1 ### and guess what you don't have to bring any quarters because the washer and dryer are free
3531, 1 ### i asked crystal the price of the cookie that i had selected and she said three dollars
3533, 1 ### the weeks before the dance the house is in a flurry and i don't know who's more excited the staff or the kids
3534, 0 ### over the years i've convinced him to shuttle those sweet furry beasts up to hang out with our sick kids from time to time
3535, 0 ### the lights on the ward were fluorescent and too bright
3536, 0 ### rather than the bright noisy quarters of the hospital their rooms are calm and comfortable with actual living spaces for the families a sanctuary of gardens and a wonderful outdoor playground with special structures for children with physical limitations
3537, 0 ### he went on hikes with his parents
3538, 1 ### i'm jewish but i'm jewish in the same way the olive garden is italian
3539, 1 ### thank you for that reaction
3540, 1 ### because living so was killing me
3541, 1 ### and you can see there they're shopping with their helmets
3542, 1 ### it was like something out of
3543, 1 ### there's trains and planes and cars and bill o'reilly he's very noisy
3544, 1 ### and you can almost trick yourself into thinking you're eating doritos
3545, 0 ### and this was an amazing year
3546, 0 ### this was no small feat because if you listen to dermatologists they say that you should have a shot glass full of sunscreen
3547, 0 ### so that took a lot of time
3548, 0 ### my cholesterol went down i lost weight my wife stopped telling me that i looked pregnant
3549, 0 ### so they think it's actually very deadly
3550, 0 ### and the second point i want to make the final point is that and it's actually been a theme of that joy is so important to your health that very few of these behaviors will stick with me unless there's some sense of pleasure and joy in them
3551, 0 ### so thank you very much
3552, 1 ### that's what i have behind myself
3556, 1 ### but let me remind you this december it did snow in vegas
3558, 1 ### it's almost like leaving congress
3559, 1 ### but then if you lose one of those second set of teeth they don't unless if you're a lawyer
3560, 1 ### and all we've got is a
3562, 0 ### and here's his second bit of advice
3564, 0 ### if you look at the federal budget this is what it looks like
3566, 0 ### and unless you want this person to not just become the of florida but the united states we'd better deal with this stuff
3568, 0 ### and let me recap some of the stuff you've seen
3571, 0 ### but now moving from bacterial engineering to tissue engineering let me show you what's happened in that period of time
3572, 1 ### this work has been done with an extraordinary group of people and they've done all the work and i'm the great that tries to bring it all together
3573, 0 ### here's some numbers
3574, 1 ### but trust me i work in advertising
3575, 1 ### they said obviously tried to dissociate themselves from drugs but said it reminds me of one thing and that's the value of the brand has stayed consistent
3576, 0 ### no one knows who or what he is
3577, 0 ### and the reason that it's proved very successful is it's private it's anonymous it's fast and it's cheap
3578, 1 ### and then because you've felt that satisfaction you're less motivated to do the actual hard work necessary
3581, 0 ### peter wrote a whole book about this and in he did some new tests that were published
3583, 1 ### and so i though i would come and try and put spaghetti sauce behind me
3584, 1 ### so they had their own norden throughout the entire war which also by the way didn't work very well
3585, 0 ### and of course the swiss can be divided into two general categories those who make small exquisite expensive objects and those who handle the money of those who buy small exquisite expensive objects
3587, 0 ### the that were available were incredibly crude
3589, 1 ### it's not a good idea but it's just important
3590, 1 ### you might argue about the sanity of it but the leverage is real
3592, 0 ### what this shows is that the rate of growth of our emissions is accelerating
3593, 0 ### cheap meaning sort of the cost of the military not the cost of medical care
3594, 1 ### allegiance very intimate serious mistakes and tattoos tell you a lot of stories
3595, 1 ### so you can take a picture with an and get all the names although again sometimes it does make mistakes
3597, 0 ### remember he did a horrible thing condemned for all time to roll this rock up it would roll back down roll back up roll back down
3598, 0 ### lesson number three atalanta
3599, 0 ### she'd run ahead and he'd roll a little golden apple
3600, 1 ### but instead of a bellows i had a leaf blower
3601, 1 ### but this is it
3602, 0 ### and the situation it describes is the hero of the book he's a century man finds himself alone on a strange planet populated only by a technologically primitive people
3603, 0 ### so i thought okay i'll start with five
3604, 1 ### it's particularly horrible in la
3605, 1 ### so i think there's a fairly straightforward series of steps to get somewhere in excess of an order of magnitude improvement in the cost per mile and our target actually is we've got a pet snail called gary this is from gary the snail from south park i mean sorry
3606, 1 ### so gary is capable of currently he's capable of going times faster than a tunnel boring machine
3607, 1 ### we want to beat gary
3608, 1 ### let's just say that if something's flying over your head a whole bunch of flying cars going all over the place that is not an anxiety reducing situation
3609, 1 ### very funny
3611, 1 ### this is what an musk hobby looks like
3612, 1 ### ok
3613, 1 ### you shouldn't be certainly
3615, 1 ### yeah
3616, 1 ### and if you had a tug competition the tesla semi will tug the diesel semi uphill
3617, 1 ### i don't know what it is and i don't know that it ends well but it's a great movie
3618, 1 ### that's a real fake house
3620, 1 ### it's just blur
3621, 1 ### ok
3623, 1 ### yeah and that's the vehicle
3624, 1 ### em yeah
3627, 0 ### first of all you have to be able to integrate the entrance and exit of the tunnel seamlessly into the fabric of the city
3628, 0 ### so a key rebuttal to the tunnels is that if you add one layer of tunnels that will simply alleviate congestion it will get used up and then you'll be back where you started back with congestion
3629, 0 ### i think we need to have at least a tenfold improvement in the cost per mile of tunneling
3631, 0 ### and looking at tunneling technology it turns out that in order to make a tunnel you have to in order to seal against the water table you've got to typically design a tunnel wall to be good to about five or six
3632, 0 ### you could dig as much as you want
3635, 0 ### yeah it's looking quite good for starting production in july
3636, 0 ### the whole road system is meant to be navigated with passive optical or cameras and so once you solve cameras or vision then autonomy is solved
3637, 0 ### they can't yet do what that showed
3638, 0 ### so it's not sort of limited to la to new york
3639, 0 ### the thing to appreciate about vehicle safety is this is
3643, 0 ### you could go off grid kind of
3644, 0 ### eventually you can sort of roughly see that there's sort of a diamond shape overall and when it's fully done it'll look like a giant diamond or that's the idea behind it and it's aligned on true north
3645, 0 ### most likely a hundred
3646, 0 ### yeah probably four
3648, 0 ### talk us through this
3649, 0 ### so it's important to appreciate that is only relevant if it is rapid and complete
3651, 0 ### all this noise around us actually has information
3652, 1 ### i mean this is this is the world headquarters
3653, 1 ### i'm told that at mental institutions they use that on the walls
3654, 1 ### when a photographer shows up i dress up so i have clothes on
3658, 1 ### is the one that used to be the most commonly used and i hated with a passion and refused to touch it and tried something else that was radical and interesting and everybody else hated
3659, 1 ### yes
3660, 1 ### i was clearly more interested in the rubik's cube than my younger brother
3661, 1 ### and then when i try to explain to them that maybe you're nice maybe you should be more aggressive they see that as me being not nice
3663, 1 ### i mean if i was stranded on an island and the only way to get off that island was the make a pretty i'd die there
3665, 1 ### i mean there are people who name their companies after him
3666, 1 ### that's good
3667, 1 ### no
3668, 0 ### if the cat comes up it sits in my lap
3669, 0 ### but it was really about the fact that i was looking for a project on my own and there was no open source really on my radar at all
3670, 0 ### and other people approached me
3672, 0 ### so all the technologists that i talk to really credit you with massively changing their work
3673, 0 ### apparently my sister said that my biggest exceptional quality was that i would not let go
3674, 0 ### i lived in silicon valley for seven years
3675, 0 ### talk about that a bit
3676, 0 ### but you can actually you can find things that you don't even agree to disagree it's just that you're interested in really different things
3678, 0 ### because what happens in a singly linked list this is trying to remove an existing entry from a list and there's a difference between if it's the first entry or whether it's an entry in the middle
3679, 0 ### and it doesn't really matter i don't want you understand why it doesn't have the if statement but i want you to understand that sometimes you can see a problem in a different way and rewrite it so that a special case goes away and becomes the normal case
3681, 0 ### this is the kind of person i am
3682, 0 ### trust me
3685, 1 ### and they talked a lot about the weather how lovely it was that the sun had come out
3686, 1 ### never mind that i had no idea what ginger beer was
3687, 1 ### she asked if she could listen to what she called my tribal music and was consequently very disappointed when i produced my tape of mariah carey
3688, 1 ### although i still get quite irritable when africa is referred to as a country the most recent example being my otherwise wonderful flight from lagos two days ago in which there was an announcement on the virgin flight about the charity work in india africa and other countries
3690, 1 ### and that it was such a shame that young americans were serial murderers
3692, 1 ### when i learned some years ago that writers were expected to have had really unhappy childhoods to be successful i began to think about how i could invent horrible things my parents had done to me
3693, 1 ### now you must write a sequel and this is what will happen
3694, 0 ### there weren't many of them available and they weren't quite as easy to find as the foreign books
3695, 0 ### but the unintended consequence was that i did not know that people like me could exist in literature
3697, 0 ### then one saturday we went to his village to visit and his mother showed us a beautifully patterned basket made of dyed that his brother had made
3698, 0 ### after referring to the black africans as beasts who have no houses he writes they are also people without heads having their mouth and eyes in their breasts
3699, 0 ### the professor told me that my characters were too much like him an educated and middle class man
3700, 0 ### and as often happens in america immigration became synonymous with mexicans
3702, 0 ### and so as a child i saw jam disappear from the breakfast table then margarine disappeared then bread became too expensive then milk became rationed
3703, 0 ### but there are other stories that are not about catastrophe and it is very important it is just as important to talk about them
3704, 1 ### i don't have any patents and i've never received any money from a medical imaging company and i am not seeking your vote
3705, 1 ### he quotes one innovator who says the only time a physician and a physicist get together is when the physicist gets sick
3706, 1 ### now take a look at this cartoon that accompanied article and tell me if you see something disturbing about this depiction of innovative thinkers
3709, 0 ### the radiologists were in turn criticized for protecting their own financial self interest
3710, 0 ### and that proportion is primarily genetically determined
3711, 0 ### the next category is scattered densities followed by dense and extremely dense
3712, 1 ### or think about the fact that if you build an automobile i'll tell you that you also inside it have to put a factory that allows you to make another automobile
3713, 1 ### let's look at the mathematics
3715, 1 ### here's what we do
3716, 1 ### this is what he's doing to his thesis project very robust if a graduate student does that to his thesis project
3717, 1 ### this is the making its first outing in a demo
3718, 1 ### sort of an alternating tripod and they can negotiate obstacles just like the animal
3720, 1 ### and just to convince them we should go to mars in i tinted the video orange just to give them the sense of being on mars
3721, 1 ### here's the gecko mill
3722, 1 ### many companies are interested in this
3724, 0 ### i want to try to share just a little bit of that with you in this presentation
3725, 0 ### you need to discover the general principles of nature and then use these analogies when they're advantageous
3726, 0 ### what we discovered was that and eight legged animals all produce the same forces on the ground when they move
3727, 0 ### and then they alternate in their propulsion but the patterns are all the same
3729, 0 ### human technologies have tended to be large flat with right angles stiff made of metal
3730, 0 ### this is a collaboration we have with stanford
3731, 0 ### it goes up to four meters per second when it runs
3732, 0 ### and we were certain they couldn't do this
3734, 0 ### i'm going show you a video
3736, 1 ### no i don't do that i'm a who is someone who pretends to be a real magician
3737, 1 ### for example when i walked up here and i took the microphone from the stand and switched it on you assumed this was a microphone which it is not
3739, 1 ### these are not glasses these are empty frames
3740, 1 ### well it's not that great a convenience
3741, 1 ### now to my innocent mind dead implies incapable of communicating
3742, 1 ### but it is a cruel vicious absolutely i'll be all right keep your seats game that these people play
3745, 1 ### you see these folks on television they never call anybody back from hell
3748, 1 ### i just ingested six and a half days worth of sleeping pills
3750, 1 ### diluting it down to the point where there's none of it left
3752, 1 ### he forgot to take his pill
3753, 0 ### i will take enough of these
3755, 0 ### now i have two questions i would like to ask these people if i had the opportunity to do so
3756, 0 ### and i love you and i'll always be with you
3761, 0 ### you can tell it's her
3762, 0 ### she did this on the larry king live show on cnn six and a half years ago
3763, 0 ### they need to be stopped because this is a cruel farce
3764, 0 ### you've heard of it
3765, 0 ### they might some place out there
3767, 0 ### largely it's the media who are to blame for this sort of thing
3768, 0 ### go in there and look at the archives and you will begin to understand much more of what i've been talking about today
3769, 0 ### we're waiting for the psychics to come forth and snap at it
3770, 1 ### we have made it quite clear to these people that an infinite monkey cage is roomy
3771, 1 ### yes they gave monkeys a typewriter for a week and after a week they only used it as a bathroom
3772, 1 ### astrology for instance like many i'm a pisces
3773, 1 ### if you ever think that your life is rubbish always remember there's another you that's made much worse decisions than that
3774, 1 ### for instance my wife could turn to me and she may say why do you love me and i can with all honesty look her in the eye and say because our pheromones matched our olfactory receptors
3776, 1 ### i stopped observing the house for a moment and when i started observing again everything had happened
3777, 0 ### well there is one proviso
3779, 0 ### you may well have your own children and think oh no my child's best
3780, 0 ### i've done some tests
3781, 0 ### i'm sitting on a chair
3782, 0 ### steven weinberg the nobel laureate once said the more the universe seems comprehensible the more it seems pointless
3783, 0 ### i can make my own purpose
3784, 1 ### for those of you who are from new york this is street under the west side highway
3787, 0 ### landscape ecology concerns itself with how the stream and the meadow and the forest and the cliffs make habitats for plants and animals
3788, 1 ### so for those of you who are stressed by this picture i will add somebody for you
3789, 1 ### so don't fear it's not for a few billion years so there's some time to prepare
3790, 0 ### but here we are on a planet and there are so many things that are amazing about earth that we're searching far and wide to find things that are like that
3791, 0 ### and this tenuous veneer around our planet is what allows life to flourish
3792, 1 ### what she discovered just by being curiously aware when she smoked was that smoking tastes like shit
3793, 0 ### the instruction was simple enough but i was missing something really important
3794, 1 ### they're about migration and strength and then you look at the sunfish
3795, 1 ### i said now that's a true american
3796, 1 ### and they come and give the you can see they strike this funny little position that says i'm not threatening but i need a massage
3797, 0 ### now jellyfish are strangely hypnotic and beautiful and you'll see lots of gorgeous ones at the aquarium on friday but they sting like hell and jellyfish sushi and is just not going to fill you up
3798, 0 ### it reaches up to almost pounds on a diet of jellyfish primarily
3799, 0 ### of course evolution is somewhat random and you know about million years ago there was this rebellious little puffer fish faction that said oh the heck with the coral reefs we're going to head to the high seas
3801, 1 ### i am a bit more primitive like a beta version of translate
3802, 0 ### thank you
3806, 1 ### i was having lunch with him just a few minutes ago and a nigerian journalist comes and this will only make sense if you've ever watched a james bond movie and a nigerian journalist comes up to him and goes aha we meet again mr
3809, 1 ### but harry's wife is confused because she said you know harry had been packing his own lunch for years
3810, 1 ### it makes sense now when i think about it because if you'd known my father you would've wanted to poison him too
3811, 1 ### now for those of you who have seen me at the buffet tables know that it was because it was costing them too much to feed me
3812, 1 ### my friend ronald gottesman says there are three kinds of people in the world those who can count and those who can't
3814, 0 ### it comes from popular culture
3816, 0 ### and it's important to know is a tonal language and so they'll say the word and same spelling one means sky or heaven and one means bicycle or iron
3817, 0 ### the language actually makes the world in which we live
3818, 0 ### nigeria got its independence in
3819, 0 ### so there's tom dick and harry and they're working construction
3820, 1 ### i thought what a great way to get to school
3821, 1 ### so that's an asset because if you've got to deal with the crash protection issues of the automobile forget it you're never going to fly it
3822, 1 ### it's often been described because of its fragile nature and its complexity as a series of parts a large number of parts flying in formation
3823, 1 ### and the adage that i'm referring to that applied at that time was that nothing comes down faster than a aircraft upside down
3824, 1 ### the parachutes are there hopefully more for psychological than real reasons but they will be an ultimate backup if it comes to that
3825, 1 ### but you better be the first one out of town as the real estate values go to hell
3826, 0 ### and they've actually issued a pilot's license a pilot's license for this type of aircraft
3827, 0 ### i only get to fly this vehicle occasionally and only when i can persuade my stockholders to let me do so but it's still one of those wonderful experiences that reward you for all that time
3829, 0 ### as that disappeared we came in with highways
3831, 0 ### unbeknownst to many of you the highway in the sky that i'm talking about here has been under construction for years
3832, 1 ### we looked at cost
3835, 0 ### if we add to that the many of us here now who are more productive because they have a pair of glasses then almost one in five indians will require eye care a staggering million people
3838, 1 ### the real epidemic is anxiety over memory loss
3839, 1 ### i also figured that old people were depressed because they were old and they were going to die soon
3841, 1 ### senior moment quips for example i stopped making them when it dawned on me that when i lost the car keys in high school i didn't call it a junior moment
3842, 1 ### my other knee doesn't hurt and it's just as old
3843, 1 ### in silicon valley engineers are getting and hair plugged before key interviews and these are skilled white men in their so imagine the effects further down the food chain
3846, 0 ### what else was i worried about dementia
3847, 0 ### the reason is discrimination and stereotyping on the basis of age
3852, 0 ### it is a natural powerful lifelong process that unites us all
3853, 0 ### people with more positive feelings towards aging walk faster they do better on memory tests they heal quicker and they live longer
3854, 1 ### when i was i dropped out of college dropped out kicked out splitting hairs
3855, 1 ### they used to tell their neighbors and friends our son he's taking a gap decade
3857, 0 ### we were a lower middle class family but that's of course not real poverty
3858, 0 ### it introduced the west to grinding poverty around the world
3860, 1 ### i basically practice for finding money on the street
3861, 1 ### and they didn't just all chase jeeps around
3862, 1 ### and everybody's happy about that
3863, 1 ### so i assume everybody knows that if you actually had a piece of amber and it had an insect in it and you drilled into it and you got something out of that insect and you cloned it and you did it over and over and over again you'd have a room full of mosquitos
3864, 1 ### so we don't have to make a dinosaur because we already have them
3866, 1 ### you can't argue with it because we're the and we've classified it that way
3868, 1 ### i guess we could make a glow chicken
3869, 1 ### that's better than a glowing chicken
3870, 1 ### so what we're trying to do really is take our chicken modify it and make the
3871, 1 ### and quite frankly i think if colonel sanders was to be careful how he worded it he could actually advertise an extra piece
3872, 0 ### i wasn't very good at reading things
3873, 0 ### so it was pretty interesting stuff
3874, 0 ### you all know the story right
3875, 0 ### they found these red circular looking objects and they looked for all the world like red blood cells
3876, 0 ### that was interesting
3877, 0 ### we found a lot of but we found one special and we called it b rex
3878, 0 ### tissue is the calcium build up the calcium storage basically when an animal is pregnant when a bird is pregnant
3879, 0 ### there were flexible clear blood vessels
3880, 0 ### and so we built a laboratory in the back of an trailer and actually took the laboratory to the field where we could get better samples
3882, 0 ### we started out with a wolf like creature and we ended up with a maltese
3885, 1 ### from this kind of made with human hair to these chocolate to these intra toe candies that your lover is supposed to suck from your toes
3887, 0 ### and so i start thinking max and all those swiss designers together trying to outdo and come up with a new sans typeface and the movie starts playing in my head already
3888, 1 ### and i should know because during the time i attended that school a military takeover happened in my country a gunman of my nationality nearly killed the pope and turkey got zero points in the song contest
3889, 1 ### and because god loves her i did get married
3890, 1 ### i liked your book he said but i wish you had written it differently
3891, 1 ### we were three writers one from the one turkish and one indonesian like a joke you know
3892, 0 ### shortly after my parents got separated and i came to turkey with my mom
3893, 0 ### this was a woman who read coffee grounds to see the future and melted lead into mysterious shapes to fend off the evil eye
3895, 0 ### but if we have no connection whatsoever with the worlds beyond the one we take for granted then we too run the risk of drying up inside
3896, 1 ### however i also have reason to believe that many if not most of you are actually tying your shoes incorrectly
3897, 0 ### if we start over and simply go the other direction around the bow we get this the strong form of the knot
3900, 1 ### now the ones that show that needle programs aren't effective you think that's one of these annoying dynamic slides and i'm going to press my and the rest of it's going to come up but no that's the whole slide
3901, 1 ### so what we see is that voters respond very well to things like this and not quite so well to things like this
3903, 0 ### so he injects the first guy and then he's wiping the needle on his shirt and he injects the next guy
3905, 0 ### yeah by sharing needles
3908, 1 ### in and early i wrote about columns with the following theme don't worry donald trump will never be the republican nominee
3911, 1 ### i do think he's a moral freak and i think he'll be undone by that fact the fact that he just doesn't know anything about anything and is about it
3913, 1 ### and failing
3918, 1 ### america i am sorry
3922, 0 ### it didn't just happen overnight
3925, 0 ### and he would say yes it is gretchen
3926, 0 ### and so human dignity whether it would be the dust up about the disabled reporter or what happened in that audiotape with billy bush and the way in which he spoke about women they put that aside and pretended as if they hadn't seen that or heard that because to them policies were more important
3927, 0 ### they see a man of action
3929, 0 ### it was democrats wanted to use government to enhance equality republicans wanted to limit government to enhance freedom
3931, 1 ### and i'd say i'm a little to the left like all the way to the left
3932, 1 ### so as an example i would change computer screen saver to a picture of mitt romney or she would put an campaign magnet on the back of my car
3933, 1 ### we have chosen to avoid political debate and instead engage in dialogue in order to maintain what we fondly call our bipartisan friendship
3934, 1 ### and this election and all of the craziness that has followed has given us several opportunities to practice this skill
3935, 1 ### at this point you can probably guess which one of us participated
3936, 1 ### so i'm already feeling kind of aggravated and then i see this from pop up in my social media feed
3937, 0 ### we go for the attack and we spot a weakness in someone's argument
3938, 0 ### you make it sound so simple
3939, 0 ### i could take the easy way out and just choose not to say anything to her and instead just kind of simmer in my frustration or i could ask her to learn more about her motivations
3940, 0 ### and frankly my assumptions were wrong
3941, 0 ### talk to someone outside of your political party who might challenge your thinking
3942, 0 ### i know this is a hard night for you guys
3943, 0 ### thank you
3944, 1 ### the only thing i had to do was go out pick them up and have them stuffed for the collection
3947, 1 ### the first case of homosexual in the mallard anas i knew i'd seen something special but it took me six years to decide to publish it
3948, 1 ### as you probably know in science when you write a kind of special paper only six or seven people read it
3952, 0 ### this is a turkey in wisconsin on the premises of the ethan allen juvenile correctional institution
3953, 0 ### it's been there for three days and it's laying on its back
3954, 0 ### he sees an intruder in his territory and it's coming all the time and he's there so there is no end to it
3956, 1 ### i was once late to my own speech on time management
3958, 1 ### that way you save eight minutes every half hour so in the course of two hours of watching tv you find minutes to exercise
3960, 1 ### if you offered to pay me to dust my blinds i would get to it pretty quickly
3961, 1 ### i'm sure many of you like me come december get cards that contain these folded up sheets of colored paper on which is written what is known as the family holiday letter
3962, 1 ### don't send it
3963, 1 ### most of us are not sitting there on friday afternoons saying i am excited to make progress toward my personal and professional priorities right now
3965, 1 ### they found that people claiming hour work weeks were off by about hours
3966, 0 ### i recently did a time diary project looking at days in the lives of extremely busy women
3967, 0 ### all this is being recorded on her time log
3969, 0 ### i remember it was a thursday morning and she was not available to speak with me
3971, 0 ### first you can read some other family histories get a sense for the style
3972, 0 ### then look out over the whole of the next week and see where you can plan them in
3973, 0 ### but i do think that the numbers i am about to tell you are empowering
3975, 0 ### maybe it's choosing to read something wonderful on the bus on the way to work
3977, 1 ### this is a well known phenomenon
3979, 1 ### this has to be a bridge to the point where you can get to wind to the point where you can get to solar to the point where you can get to nuclear and hopefully you won't build the next nuclear plant on a beautiful seashore next to an earthquake fault
3981, 0 ### you're going to be able to power stuff so irrigation makes a difference
3983, 0 ### that is something that a lot of people have criticized
3984, 1 ### here's a time lapse of one of the time lapse units being made
3985, 0 ### specifically i as a person who's been a professional nature photographer my whole adult life am firmly of the belief that photography video film have tremendous powers for helping us understand and shape the way we think about nature and about ourselves in relationship to nature
3986, 1 ### that's right
3988, 0 ### i understood them all even if they didn't always understand each other they were all my people
3990, 1 ### so freight costs aren't our biggest problem
3991, 0 ### and the mosquito has killed more humans than wars and plague
3992, 1 ### you sort of get down there to the bottom and things get really dicey
3994, 1 ### because finally there was a page that actually felt like what it felt like to hit a
3996, 0 ### and that's not a good experience when you're used to experiences like this
3997, 0 ### it turned into a contest
3998, 1 ### okay
3999, 1 ### and since my article was titled why the world isn't flat that wasn't too surprising
4000, 1 ### i remember i decided to write my why the world isn't flat article because i was being interviewed on tv in and the first question to me was professor why do you still believe that the world is round and i started laughing because i hadn't come across that formulation before
4005, 0 ### so let's start off with plain old telephone service
4007, 0 ### and then finally the one statistic that i suspect many of the people in this room have seen the export ratio
4008, 0 ### non negligible so we don't live in an entirely local or national world but very very far from the percent level that you would expect and the very simple
4012, 1 ### so i just took a short clip from batman begins here just to show christian pulse
4014, 1 ### and that's actually my eye and again this video was taken right after my daughter was born so you can see i wasn't getting too much sleep
4015, 1 ### it's kind of creepy
4016, 1 ### this is me demonstrating my great singing skills
4017, 1 ### and of course surveillance is the first application that comes to mind
4018, 0 ### and it lets us look at our world in a completely new way
4020, 0 ### we make them bigger to create those types of enhanced videos or magnified videos that actually show us those changes
4021, 0 ### it can work on your own videos
4022, 0 ### it's like seeing still pictures come to life
4023, 0 ### sound as we all know is basically changes in air pressure that travel through the air
4027, 1 ### i'm going to show grandma to you
4030, 0 ### for example if a person from that red group has to pick up the package leaflet of a medicinal product to give a dose of medicine to child can't can't understand the information
4031, 0 ### now just so you don't think this is normal that over there is sweden
4033, 1 ### it's a perfect evocation of that great population survey the six largest nations in the world in descending order china india the united states and indonesia
4034, 1 ### the headline was nato admiral needs friends
4037, 0 ### we go into the cold war and we continue to try and build walls
4040, 0 ### last year at this time there were vessels mariners held hostage
4041, 0 ### this is part of which is a discontinuity in the global economy
4043, 1 ### but let's come back to it
4045, 1 ### and to realize that people across the world are genuinely invested in the status of your new relationship
4046, 1 ### i want the happy ending implied by the title to my article which is incidentally the only part of the article that i didn't actually write
4049, 0 ### so my first impulse in the face of all of this attention was to become very protective of my own relationship
4051, 0 ### they've used it between members of the police and members of community and they've used it between people of opposing political ideologies
4052, 1 ### the good news is i'm very aware of my responsibilities to get you out of here because i'm the only thing standing between you and the bar
4053, 1 ### and so for the remaining two years of my high school i cut all my classes
4054, 1 ### and in that row house i started manchester guild and i learned very quickly that wherever there are episcopalians there's money in very close proximity
4055, 1 ### and the reason it has a fountain in the courtyard is i wanted one and i had the checkbook so i bought one and put it there
4056, 1 ### as you can see it has world class art and it's all my taste because i raised all the money
4057, 1 ### and he called me into his office which is the equivalent of going to see the wizard of oz and john heinz had million dollars and at the time i had about cents
4058, 1 ### and senator heinz sat very quietly and he said well what would your reaction be if i said i'd give you a million dollars i said senator it appears that we're going into the food training business
4059, 1 ### i've actually eaten seven of those baskets and they're very good
4060, 1 ### you have to tone down the jesus stuff a little bit but keep the enthusiasm
4062, 1 ### that's the place all filled up with republicans
4063, 1 ### and i can now tell you with absolute certainty that an appearance on oprah winfrey will sell cds
4064, 1 ### and there's the fountain
4065, 1 ### and i love them because they pay the rent on time
4066, 1 ### and this is what i want to do when i grow up
4070, 0 ### what i'm going to show you for a couple of minutes is a facility that i built in the toughest neighborhood in pittsburgh with the highest crime rate
4071, 0 ### he's making a ton of money doing custom furniture for rich people
4072, 0 ### i said well i got in my car and i went out to the greenhouse and i bought them and i brought them back and i put them there
4073, 0 ### that's puff pastry day
4074, 0 ### we have students who sit together black kids and white kids and what we've discovered is you can solve the race problem by creating a world class environment because people will have a tendency to show you world class behavior if you treat them in that way
4075, 0 ### there is absolutely no reason why poor people can't learn world class technology
4079, 0 ### and these are examples of some of the kids' work
4080, 0 ### because now it's become socially not acceptable not to show up to support your children at the manchester guild because people think you're bad parents
4081, 0 ### i even stuck another room on the building which i'd like to show you
4084, 0 ### and now that i have i want to give you a gift
4085, 0 ### and he showed up and said dizzy talking about you all over the country man and i want to help you
4086, 1 ### yes your happy place i know you've got one even if it's fake
4087, 1 ### a fork is a simple tool

4595, 0 ### it stands for mutually assured destruction
4596, 0 ### now the odd thing is that even though we knew that there would be that kind of civilization we engaged in america in a series and in fact in the soviet union in a series of response planning
4598, 1 ### i would run into the living room jump up on the couch rip the cushions off throw them on the floor scream at the top of my lungs and run out because i was the incredible hulk

4708, 0 ### these people did not let rejection define them
4711, 1 ### and i think it's fair to say already that there are people in this audience at this moment displaying psychological symptoms i would like to discuss today
4713, 1 ### or you may say of yourself i am intriguing even if i am regarded by most people as a great thundering
4714, 1 ### with my classes i sometimes give them a basic fact that might be revealing with respect to their personality i tell them that it is virtually impossible for adults to lick the outside of their own elbow

4738, 1 ### but more importantly being seven means that you've reached the age of reason and you're now capable of committing any and all sins against god and man

4741, 1 ### julie there is no santa claus
4742, 1 ### i mean my dad had a very distinctive wrapping style and my mother's handwriting was so close to santa's

4753, 1 ### i got an almost percent response rate
4754, 1 ### time spent with you is like chasing and catching small birds but without the scratches and bird shit
4755, 1 ### but i just have to tell you because sometimes i hear your self doubt and it's so crushing to think that you may not know how truly wonderful you are how inspiring and delightful and really truly the most completely
4757, 0 ### but i find that for myself without exception the more i deal with the work as something of my own as something that is personal the more successful it is as something that's compelling interesting and sustaining
4758, 0 ### so i have a particular imaginative approach to visual work
4759, 0 ### and puzzling it is
4760, 0 ### but all i have to do is fill certain areas of those and i can bring those words out of the background pattern
4761, 0 ### and this project began essentially on my kitchen table
4762, 1 ### with no support from her husband she caused a sensation by taking him to court and prosecuting her own case and a far greater sensation when she won
4763, 0 ### imagine the first piece a man burning his life's work
4765, 1 ### i thought perhaps if i was hanging on long enough that would guide me through the minutes
4766, 1 ### i studied cooking in school for four years and in that experience which was called domestic science it was a bit of a cheap trick for me to try and get a science qualification

4777, 0 ### and we should be developing things we should be developing packaging for ideas which elevate people's perceptions and respect for the things that we dig out of the earth and translate into products for everyday use
4779, 0 ### a few years ago i reinvented my process to keep up with people like greg lynn thom mayne hadid rem koolhaas all these people that i think are and pioneering with fantastic new ideas of how to create form
4780, 0 ### we look at how that is produced
4781, 0 ### this is the final product
4782, 0 ### it's mass individualism from a single product
4783, 0 ### these new ideas for materials will come into play in probably a decade
4784, 0 ### this is the freaky side coming out
4787, 0 ### i'm also interested in growth patterns the unbridled way that nature grows things so you're not restricted by form at all
4788, 1 ### it's something that since it was invented a year or two ago has given me untold happiness
4789, 1 ### a little bit of it i think is the nicotine but there's something much bigger than that which is ever since in the they banned smoking in public places i've never enjoyed a drinks party ever again

4792, 1 ### if you're an upper middle-class english person you call unemployment a year off
4793, 1 ### but having a son who's unemployed in thailand is really viewed as quite an accomplishment
4794, 1 ### i'm probably in the wrong country to talk about willingness to pay tax

4799, 0 ### the other dog doesn't have the button
4801, 0 ### but this does not apply the other way around
4802, 0 ### if you actually look at a great business you'll nearly always see all of these three things coming into play
4803, 0 ### all of you know this actually from when you go in to buy a television and in the end of the row of flat screen you can see are these rather despised things called combined tv and players
4804, 0 ### don't give them white pills give them white pills and six blue ones and tell them to take the white pills first and then take the blue ones
4806, 0 ### what was interesting about the austrian school is they actually grew up alongside freud
4807, 0 ### von mises interestingly believes economics is just a subset of psychology
4809, 0 ### thank you very much
4810, 1 ### he's incredibly fast at it too faster than i am in fact
4811, 0 ### great idea but it doesn't work at all
4812, 1 ### my english lost i wanted to vomit
4813, 1 ### many people including my mother said i was crazy
4816, 0 ### this is me with my dad when i was a little boy
4818, 0 ### i felt very happy to be at the secondary school so i was determined to do anything possible to receive education
4820, 1 ### i said what is that dad a job

4824, 1 ### if al gore is here i'm going to send my fourth graders from agnor hurt and venable schools to you because they solved global warming in a week
4826, 1 ### and we learned in this you don't really ever want to cross a nine year old girl with tanks
4827, 0 ### it's a true feeling
4828, 0 ### but in her office there's this old wooden weather worn table kitchen table peeling green paint it's kind of rickety
4829, 0 ### it reminds me of what goes on around an empty space sometimes
4831, 0 ### chris could you stand up and let them see you a young visionary filmmaker who's made a film
4833, 0 ### and they weren't flashing in anger they were flashing in love intense love for her students
4834, 1 ### wow some century
4835, 1 ### i think that's good luck
4836, 1 ### you're not even going to be able to answer her questions
4838, 1 ### and then they had to straighten out my nose and they took these rods and shoved them up my nose and went up through my brains and felt like it was coming out the top of my head and everybody said that it should have killed me but it didn't because i guess i have a high tolerance for pain
4839, 0 ### oh let me kind of tell you a funny little play bit
4840, 0 ### so we got this voice on this train concourse one omaha lincoln
4841, 0 ### well some of you are laughing
4842, 0 ### so i'm going to talk to the baby
4844, 1 ### she enjoys making what she calls paper laptops
4846, 1 ### no what i'm suggesting is that we should leap off we should increase our velocity so it's high and we should leap off one side and go the other of course having calculated our differential equation very carefully
4848, 0 ### see in the real world math isn't necessarily done by mathematicians
4849, 0 ### you wouldn't have expected that a few years back
4850, 1 ### anyway last year i heard about the himalayas and the melting of the and the melting of the glaciers because of climate change
4851, 1 ### i have never ever heard such utter
4852, 0 ### it's flipping freezing in that water
4853, 0 ### and with a population increasing as quickly as it is and with the water supply from these glaciers because of climate change decreasing so much i think we have a real risk of instability
4854, 1 ### sorry
4855, 1 ### they've spent the night squirming across your face and having sex on the bridge of your nose
4856, 1 ### many of them are now leaking their gut contents onto your pores
4857, 1 ### i hope you also discovered a cure for it
4859, 0 ### for the last years we've had an adversarial relationship with the microscopic life nearest us
4860, 0 ### as of a few years ago no scientist could tell you what bugs or microorganisms live in your home your home the place you know better than anywhere else
4862, 1 ### people come together to sing about the things that really bug them
4863, 0 ### and we're now in a very strange sort of twilight zone where no one quite knows what's worked or what doesn't
4864, 1 ### ever
4866, 1 ### and then i just got on with it
4867, 1 ### and i couldn't really face that so i started to challenge the conventions of the time even to the extent of changing my name from stephanie to steve in my business development letters so as to get through the door before anyone realized that he was a she
4868, 1 ### and as an example of unintended consequences my female company had to let the men in
4870, 1 ### you can always tell ambitious women by the shape of our heads they're flat on top for being patted
4871, 0 ### so let me tell you my story
4872, 0 ### although women were then coming out of the universities with decent degrees there was a glass ceiling to our progress
4873, 0 ### and who would have guessed that the programming of the black box flight recorder of supersonic concord would have been done by a bunch of women working in their own homes
4874, 0 ### giles was the first resident in the first house of the first charity that i set up to pioneer services for autism
4876, 1 ### right so a bit of trivia about that era for you
4879, 1 ### i think i have candies in my purse older than years old
4880, 1 ### right so next subject is a young woman next subject class is a young woman called bella a university student interviewed in during what was called an intro to feminist porn class as part of her major in sex work at a college in the bay area
4882, 1 ### so for your record i am like a sex work studies major but minoring in social media with a concentration on notable
4884, 1 ### right class
4885, 1 ### that's right
4889, 1 ### yeah and i totally believe in causes yeah like all that stuff
4890, 1 ### i'm marrying a woman
4891, 1 ### wharton
4892, 1 ### you know you don't watch bourne identity and go drive your car over a gondola in venice
4893, 0 ### yes macy all right
4894, 0 ### remember these early modules in these people's full identities were protected and this allowed them to speak more freely on our topic which for many of them was taboo
4896, 0 ### yes oh the cold is for the machines the new technology
4898, 0 ### lots of tenderness you understand
4899, 0 ### well first of all i was just trying to find you know couples normal couples making love but this so many people together at one time
4903, 0 ### that's how they market me
4904, 0 ### perfect
4905, 0 ### and i certainly didn't do myself any favors
4906, 0 ### no my one sister virginia gave me a for the coach to dublin and that's how i ended up here
4907, 0 ### well for your record my opinion of the legalization i'd say i'm against it
4912, 1 ### help i've been waiting for over minutes and nothing happens
4914, 1 ### and if you multiply that by million you get that humanity is wasting about hours every day typing these annoying
4917, 1 ### bad christians but it's even worse because the website where we showed this actually happened to be called the embassy of the kingdom of god
4920, 1 ### but first you take a and then you draw something that is related to it
4927, 1 ### by the way you did hear me correctly his last name is hacker
4928, 1 ### at often the goat time install a error is vomit
4934, 0 ### so every time you buy tickets on ticketmaster you help to digitize a book
4935, 0 ### now of course since we're doing so many words per day funny things can happen
4936, 0 ### i'm sure some of you have heard about it
4937, 0 ### it's weird they were all done with about people
4941, 0 ### so it would be very expensive
4944, 0 ### so the way this works is whenever you're a just a beginner we give you very simple sentences
4949, 0 ### we haven't yet launched it
4950, 1 ### and the house where john wilkes booth planned the assassination of abraham lincoln is also now a chinese restaurant called wok and roll on h street in washington
4954, 1 ### so that's when the chinese moved in saw a market opportunity and took over
4955, 1 ### another of my favorite dishes general chicken which by the way in the us naval academy is called admiral chicken
4956, 1 ### and he has marched very far indeed because he is sweet he is fried and he is chicken all things that americans love
4957, 1 ### has marched so far actually that the chef who originally invented the dish doesn't recognize it he's kind of horrified
4958, 1 ### believe it or not these guys were actually crossing the road
4959, 1 ### so these people are going around china asking for chop suey which is sort of like a japanese guy coming here and saying i understand you have a very popular dish in your country called
4960, 0 ### if you see them side by side there's yellow and brown
4962, 0 ### but they weren't surprised i traveled around the world to visit them because in their eyes he is after all a famous qing dynasty military hero
4963, 0 ### if they weren't eating cats they were eating rats
4964, 0 ### it's a pamphlet published by samuel hero of our american labor movement
4966, 0 ### the thing is this idea of chinese american food doesn't exist only in america
4967, 0 ### so this actually became very clear to me with the march powerball drawing where they expected based on the number of ticket sales they had to have three or four second place winners people who match five or six powerball numbers
4968, 0 ### it was lunch it was take out it was sit down it was buffet it was three weeks ago it was three months ago
4972, 1 ### i understand i said that the japanese do not put sugar in their green tea but i'd like to put some sugar in my green tea

4977, 1 ### of course you and i know that coke is the better choice
4979, 1 ### and the other one was called adorable
4980, 1 ### and the only thing they had consensus on well if i could see them i would clearly be able to tell them apart
4981, 1 ### and i brought women into the laboratory and i asked them which one would you pick percent of the women accused me of playing a trick of putting the same color nail polish in both those bottles
4983, 0 ### i'd like to discuss some of these assumptions and the problems associated with them
4984, 0 ### it's called being true to yourself
4985, 0 ### success was just as much about pleasing key figures as it was about satisfying one's own preferences
4986, 0 ### it requires that everyone treat choice as a private and self defining act
4987, 0 ### let's test this assumption by heading over to eastern europe
4988, 0 ### that's just one choice
4990, 0 ### and a young polish man said i don't need twenty kinds of chewing gum
4991, 0 ### when someone can't see how one choice is unlike another or when there are too many choices to compare and contrast the process of choosing can be confusing and frustrating
4992, 1 ### and what's more exciting than just turning what's currently in the computer physical is to start imagining how programming the world will alter even our daily physical activities
4993, 0 ### designers can materialize their ideas directly in and surgeons can practice on virtual organs underneath the screen
4994, 1 ### he was adam smith not billy connolly not sean connery though he is very smart indeed
4995, 1 ### there was a little local difficulty in some of our minor colonies but
4996, 1 ### you can play a game and try and think of one i've missed at or try and boil it down to just four but you'll lose
4997, 1 ### that really was a killer application
4998, 0 ### and we also know that most of them were or are very poor did not live for very long
4999, 0 ### and this slide here is the best simplification of the great divergence story i can offer you
5000, 0 ### in fact in the average chinese was richer than the average north american
5002, 1 ### so what is this hyperbolic geometry that corals and sea slugs embody the next few minutes is we're all going to get raised up to the level of a sea slug
5003, 0 ### it's true
5004, 1 ### i feel like i'm diagonally parked in a parallel universe
5005, 1 ### i can't wait to see them racing for the first time at daytona next month because i feel the need for speed
5006, 1 ### but you know even holding one balloon is like kind of happy
5008, 0 ### and recently i've been much more interested in collecting stories from reality so real stories
5009, 0 ### and in these books you can find these short little glimpses of moments and experiences and people that i meet
5010, 0 ### as opposed to knowing the whole story just knowing a little bit of the story and then letting your own mind fill in the rest
5011, 0 ### it's called we feel fine
5012, 1 ### you'd follow that guy back to his cubicle and you'd say why my chair okay so now it's tuesday morning and you're at the office and a meeting invitation pops up in your calendar
5013, 1 ### and when this highly unproductive session is over you go back to your desk and you stand at your desk and you say boy i wish i had those two hours back like i wish i had my chair back
5014, 0 ### and in fact some of the biggest companies in the world companies that you've heard of but i won't name have asked for my permission to use this video in their new hire training to teach their new employees how not to run a meeting at their company
5015, 0 ### or the maybe button or whatever button is there for you not to accept immediately
5019, 0 ### then one plus two is three two plus three is five three plus five is eight and so on
5021, 1 ### yeah i know
5023, 1 ### they're tasty and they make your pee smell funny
5024, 1 ### but we are the only ones using asparagus
5026, 0 ### we aren't focused on any particular problem and we're not trying to solve any particular disease
5028, 0 ### and what we're left with after removing all the apple cells is this cellulose scaffold
5029, 0 ### we used an apple and it cost pennies
5030, 1 ### she knew just how to torture me without knowing
5031, 1 ### one day they invited all these female colleagues i don't know where they came from to where i was held and they invited me to their guard room and asked if one night stands really happen in the us
5032, 0 ### patrick's day for all of you but it was the day that turned my life upside down
5034, 1 ### or maybe you're the only one who had to go to the bathroom
5035, 1 ### and my brother says i got the top grade in the class
5037, 1 ### she didn't even have a boyfriend
5038, 0 ### the numbers tell the story quite clearly
5040, 0 ### now people talk about this a lot and they talk about things like flextime and mentoring and programs companies should have to train women
5041, 0 ### i don't have the right answer
5042, 1 ### i have of these
5043, 1 ### now they didn't even care about that
5044, 1 ### what they wanted was my email address so they could ask me more questions
5045, 0 ### in other words i look for aliens and when i tell people that at a cocktail party they usually look at me with a mildly incredulous look on their face
5046, 0 ### this is the owens valley radio observatory behind the sierra and in i was working there collecting data for my thesis
5047, 0 ### so it was true
5048, 1 ### that's why this year china will become the world's largest english speaking country
5049, 0 ### goal okay religious mania there's rapture there's weeping there's visions
5051, 1 ### and of course the local people had absolutely no interest in doing that so we paid them to come and work and sometimes they would show up
5052, 1 ### but instead of asking them how come they were not growing anything we simply said thank god we're here
5053, 1 ### when the tomatoes were nice and ripe and red overnight some hippos came out from the river and they ate everything
5054, 1 ### the hippos and the said yes that's why we have no agriculture here
5055, 1 ### i shut up and listen to them
5057, 1 ### they were already drowning in manure
5058, 0 ### the book was published in
5059, 0 ### but they mean two different things
5060, 0 ### the first principle of aid is respect
5061, 0 ### we meet at the pub
5062, 0 ### the passion that that man has for his own personal growth is the most important thing
5063, 0 ### entrepreneurs never come and they never tell you in a public meeting what they want to do with their own money what opportunity they have identified
5067, 1 ### you know if god's going to show up he's not going to show up on cheese bread
5069, 0 ### i really think that there's this inner desire
5070, 1 ### that patient was my government
5071, 1 ### see many of us will agree that lots of governments are unhealthy today
5072, 1 ### when we started out i thought i was going to find so much corruption i was literally going to either die or get killed in the process
5073, 1 ### i like to think about these two years like a weight loss program
5074, 0 ### so when government one of its most vital entities is weak or unhealthy everyone and everything suffers
5075, 0 ### economies thrive when business are able to quickly and easily set up shop
5077, 0 ### we also just went back and looked at a lot of their previous paperwork to try and really understand to try and diagnose what bodily malfunctions had occurred that lead to that spot on the world bank list
5080, 1 ### i think they were given to in a box a box set of which they put on their shelves where they are now
5081, 1 ### and as chris says there is a hunger for videos of me
5083, 1 ### so this whole event has been an elaborate build up to me doing another one for you so here it is
5084, 1 ### so i want to pick up from there because i only had minutes frankly
5086, 1 ### i mean there is a major climate crisis obviously and i think if people don't believe it they should get out more
5087, 1 ### i have one climate crisis i don't really need the second one
5088, 1 ### he said there are two types of people in this world those who divide the world into two types and those who do not
5090, 1 ### i came across a great quote recently from abraham lincoln who i thought you'd be pleased to have quoted at this point
5091, 1 ### we don't teach american history in britain
5092, 1 ### you know this is our policy
5093, 0 ### if you said don't do this anymore they'd wonder what you're talking about
5094, 0 ### and high among them is education because education in a way very many people from their natural talents
5095, 0 ### what we need and the word's been used many times in the past few days is not evolution but a revolution in education
5096, 0 ### as our case is new so we must think anew and act anew
5098, 0 ### but you know we have become obsessed with this linear narrative
5100, 0 ### one is fast food where everything is standardized
5101, 0 ### my wife's just finished writing a novel and i think it's a great book but she disappears for hours on end
5102, 0 ### we have to recognize that human flourishing is not a mechanical process it's an organic process
5103, 0 ### and doing that i think is the answer to the future because it's not about scaling a new solution it's about creating a movement in education in which people develop their own solutions but with external support based on a personalized curriculum
5104, 0 ### there's been a lot of talk about dreams over the course of these few days
5105, 0 ### and we should tread softly
5106, 1 ### now this was all very good except for the problem that it didn't quite work
5107, 0 ### it's been a good run
5110, 1 ### i've got to warn you the sense in which my is upbeat has always been kind of subtle sometimes even elusive
5112, 1 ### this may not seem to impress but technological evolution is progressive so another years and armaments technology takes you here
5113, 1 ### so let's call it the death spiral of negativity
5114, 1 ### that is to say thank you thank you
5116, 1 ### i'm just doing what i can here
5118, 1 ### now the good news is that the person who said it was ann coulter
5120, 0 ### and in fact that's actually sustaining a long standing trend that predates human beings ok that biological evolution was doing for us
5121, 0 ### originally you had the most complex societies the hunter gatherer village
5122, 0 ### this is the silk road connecting the chinese empire and the roman empire
5124, 0 ### social structure adapts to accommodate this possibility and to harness this productive potential so you get cities you know and you get all the non games you don't think about that are being played across the world
5128, 0 ### i think the non dynamic which is not only economic by any means it's not always commerce but it has driven us to the verge of a moral truth which is the fundamental equality of everyone
5130, 0 ### more and more it's possible for grassroots hatred abroad to manifest itself in the form of organized violence on american soil
5131, 0 ### i've got to admit i feel silly saying that
5132, 1 ### the average age of a gamer is years old not eight years old and in fact if we look at the projected demographics of video game play the video game players of tomorrow are older adults
5134, 1 ### so most of you have a brain
5135, 1 ### if you move your eyes you're doomed
5136, 1 ### yeah
5137, 1 ### who really wants to eat chocolate covered broccoli none of you
5140, 0 ### i'd like to put this kind of friday night bar discussion aside and get you to actually step into the lab
5141, 0 ### we can step into the lab and measure how good your vision is
5143, 0 ### so we're actually leveraging that work to develop games for patients with low vision and to have an impact on retraining their brain to see better
5144, 1 ### there can be many mechanisms for this effect one possibility is that your friends say to you something like you know they adopt a behavior that spreads to you like they say let's go have muffins and beer which is a terrible combination
5146, 1 ### what was interesting to us is that the european headline writers had a different take they said are your friends gaining weight perhaps you are to blame
5147, 1 ### so for example i was giving this talk recently in new york city and i said you know when you're on the subway and the other person across the subway car smiles at you and you just instinctively smile back and they looked at me and said we don't do that in new york city
5148, 1 ### and whether you become happy or not depends in part on whether you occupy a happy patch
5151, 0 ### and second it was not restricted to pairs of people
5152, 0 ### so social networks are these intricate things of beauty and they're so elaborate and so complex and so ubiquitous in fact that one has to ask what purpose they serve
5153, 0 ### and along with my collaborator james fowler we began to wonder whether obesity really was epidemic and could it spread from person to person like the four people i discussed earlier
5154, 0 ### but the visual complexity is still very high
5156, 1 ### they then paved them
5157, 1 ### someone installed a barrier people started walking across and round the bottom as you see and they paved it
5158, 0 ### but then there's this mud trap that cuts across the middle
5159, 0 ### the first is in the capital city of brazil brasilia
5160, 1 ### keep your hands up if you know who this is
5161, 1 ### all they do is make me feel bad
5162, 1 ### i don't know if you've ever looked at the credits of a pixar movie but the babies born during a production are listed there
5163, 0 ### so along with three co conspirators i spent nearly a decade observing up close and personal exceptional leaders of innovation
5165, 0 ### when many of us think about innovation though we think about an einstein having an moment
5166, 1 ### here in biosphere well it takes me about two minutes because i pick up the phone and i call and say hey can you deliver the pizza so biosphere was essentially a three acre entirely sealed miniature world that i lived in for two years and minutes
5167, 1 ### more on that later
5168, 1 ### and we ate an awful lot of the sweet potatoes
5171, 0 ### and over the ensuing few years there were great sagas about designing biosphere
5172, 1 ### northeast airlines was the only company i heard of that was selling for less than five dollars a share
5176, 1 ### yup we really do this
5180, 0 ### and i thought this game is easy
5181, 0 ### so i made a lot of painful mistakes and with time my attitude about those mistakes began to change
5183, 0 ### people thought it was kind of a crazy point of view
5185, 0 ### so for that last years that's how we've been operating
5186, 1 ### you know what else makes my role particularly challenging people do weird things
5187, 1 ### it turns out it is also used on when people are role playing as dogs
5188, 1 ### there's a sort of inherent cognitive dissonance in doing that like when you're writing your wedding vows at the same time as your prenuptial agreement
5189, 1 ### given that i spend my days and nights imagining the worst that could happen it wouldn't be surprising if my was gloomy
5192, 0 ### we should just automatically suspend accounts engaging in this kind of behavior
5193, 0 ### this time it's sending the same message and link
5194, 1 ### i don't know where julian morrow got that from
5195, 1 ### i look for it all the time
5196, 1 ### as one of them said to me ron we ain't going anywhere at the moment
5197, 1 ### see it up there and you see it has no what do you call it no screen
5200, 1 ### it's called jaws job access with speech and it sounds like this
5203, 0 ### little did i know that i would be part of a technological revolution that would make that dream come true
5204, 0 ### it's an interaction between volunteers passionate inventors and technology and it's a story that many other blind people could tell
5206, 0 ### it meant for the first time i could read back what i had typed into it
5207, 0 ### one is another american inventor ted
5209, 0 ### many we can't read using jaws and the other technologies
5212, 1 ### actually one indication is that little boy on my husband's shoulders has just graduated from high school
5213, 1 ### we got a flood of donations mostly checks because new york times readers are very generous in tiny amounts but then we got a money transfer for really nice guy
5214, 1 ### so here is bill of arabia
5216, 0 ### she lives with her parents her two brothers and her great aunt
5217, 0 ### she went to high school
5218, 0 ### it is rare to get an exogenous investment in girls' education
5219, 0 ### in the century it was slavery
5220, 1 ### we didn't find a dinosaur
5221, 1 ### maybe we can try this at home someday i don't know
5222, 0 ### however we know still very little about what is hidden inside the earth
5224, 1 ### so i guess it is a result of globalization that you can find coca cola tins on top of everest and a buddhist monk in monterey
5225, 1 ### this is from marlboro country
5226, 1 ### they said yes but it's summertime
5227, 1 ### as a frenchman i must say that there are a lot of french intellectuals that think happiness is not at all interesting
5228, 1 ### and someone wrote an article saying don't impose on us the dirty work of happiness
5229, 1 ### we like our suffering because it's so good when it ceases for a while
5230, 1 ### it's about two meters by three and you are all welcome any time
5232, 1 ### beautiful chocolate cake first serving is delicious second one not so much then we feel disgust
5233, 1 ### they are real olympic champions of mind training
5235, 1 ### and just i leave you with the beauty of those looks that tells more about happiness than i could ever say
5237, 0 ### some people say happiness is right now it's the quality of the freshness of the present moment
5238, 0 ### if i had to hear it hours non stop it might be very tiring
5241, 0 ### there might be storms but the depth of the ocean is still there unchanged
5242, 0 ### we think that if we could gather this and that all the conditions something that we say everything to be happy to have everything to be happy
5244, 0 ### so now if the inner conditions are stronger of course the outer conditions do influence and it's wonderful to live longer healthier to have access to information education to be able to travel to have freedom
5245, 0 ### we have to know from ourselves there are certain states of mind that are conducive to this flourishing to this well being what the greeks called flourishing
5246, 0 ### we don't need any gratitude
5248, 0 ### we know we're not always angry always jealous always generous
5249, 0 ### so there are natural to emotions that are destructive to our inner well being
5250, 1 ### he studies the brain using and he claims that this is the most beautiful brain that he has ever scanned
5251, 1 ### this is a quote from brian eno the problem with computers is that there is not enough africa in them
5252, 0 ### i read about how the is constantly shuffling data back and forth between the memory the ram and the alu the arithmetic and logic unit
5257, 0 ### but after i grew up and went to college and i came home in the early this is what i found
5260, 1 ### so this is as joy mountford once said the mouse is probably the narrowest straw you could try to suck all of human expression through
5262, 1 ### i'd like to show you thing called snout which is the idea behind this project is to make a robot that appears as if it's continually surprised to see you
5263, 1 ### this language is communicating that it is surprised to see you and it's interested in looking at you
5265, 0 ### so from both directions there is kind of i think a lack of understanding about what it could mean to be an artist who uses the materials of his own day or her own day which i think artists are obliged to do is to really explore the expressive potential of the new tools that we have
5266, 0 ### because this is in some sense the first way that people discover their own potential as actors and discover their own agency
5267, 0 ### and their own personalities come out in totally unique ways
5268, 1 ### and in a minute you'll see it enter our lab which is recognizable by the clutter that you see
5270, 1 ### that joystick is just there to make sure if the robot goes crazy giuseppe can kill it
5271, 1 ### and in this next video just like you see this bird an eagle gracefully coordinating its wings its eyes and feet to grab prey out of the water our robot can go fishing too
5274, 1 ### so if i normalize that to its size it's like a boeing traveling ten times the speed of sound
5275, 1 ### it's because they're just reacting to the positions of their neighbors
5276, 0 ### and then it can assemble all these features into a map like you see behind me
5279, 0 ### and within each robot you have to think about the interplay of sensing communication computation and this network then becomes quite difficult to control and manage
5280, 0 ### now if you put these ideas together the third idea is that we essentially give these robots mathematical descriptions of the shape they need to execute
5282, 0 ### here you'll see robots traveling through an apple orchard and in a minute you'll see two of its companions doing the same thing on the left side
5283, 0 ### and on the bottom left is a thermal camera
5284, 1 ### i've never seen my mother cry like that at the end of monopoly
5286, 1 ### his favorite photograph my favorite photograph of his which i don't have in here is indian taking picture of white people taking pictures of indians
5288, 1 ### and so to me i wanted more value in this so when she asked if she could play a game i said yes
5289, 0 ### this is one my partner and i worked on
5290, 0 ### but we think about games as fun and that's completely reasonable but let's just think about this
5292, 0 ### i was the head of a college department teaching games so again it was sort of a real job and now i got to talk about making them as opposed to making them
5294, 1 ### i invented the placebo camera
5296, 1 ### i am mr micheal the son of late mr who was the minister of finance in sierra leone but was killed during the civil war
5297, 0 ### one i want to speak as early in the morning as possible
5299, 0 ### lotte an amazing shadow puppeteer in the that started doing more elaborate things
5300, 1 ### don't you in the front row worry or anything
5301, 1 ### now the people in the front row are very nervous
5302, 0 ### and i'm sitting in a waiting room some time later for an ultrasound and all six of these doctors actually show up in the room at once and i'm like uh oh this is bad news
5303, 0 ### now these people making these proclamations to me were not bad people
5305, 1 ### and the title for my cookbook was going to be dining without crumbs the art of eating over the sink
5306, 1 ### and even being here i mean the last few days i've known heights of obsessive behavior i never thought about
5307, 1 ### now the interesting thing about this is when i take the lines away it's as if you haven't learned anything in the last minute
5308, 1 ### and if we have these predictable repeatable mistakes in vision which we're so good at what are the chances we won't make even more mistakes in something we're not as good at for example financial decision making
5309, 1 ### it's percent in organ donation
5316, 1 ### the fact that you have rome without coffee makes rome with coffee look superior and not just to rome without coffee even superior to paris
5317, 1 ### this was an ad in the economist a few years ago that gave us three choices an online subscription for dollars a print subscription for dollars or you could get both for
5318, 1 ### that means our students can read
5319, 1 ### i took and i made jerry slightly less attractive
5321, 0 ### i said i don't want to write about my research
5323, 0 ### here's another one
5324, 0 ### the bottom one yellow
5325, 0 ### but again it's the same story that if we take the background away the illusion comes back
5326, 0 ### it's from a paper by johnson and goldstein
5328, 0 ### they are residing in the person who is designing that form
5329, 0 ### it's difficult and it's complex
5331, 0 ### so you refer the patient for hip replacement therapy
5335, 0 ### this is why we have these four minute dates
5336, 1 ### with the generous backing of a magazine i write for sometimes i decided to sample the very best or most expensive or most coveted item in about a dozen categories which was a very grueling quest as you can imagine
5337, 1 ### i was really happy when i was done
5338, 1 ### there were several several of these items were disappointments
5340, 1 ### and it you know tickled a little bit and it smelled good but i have to say that nobody here has complimented me on the cleanliness of my face today
5341, 1 ### but no compliments
5342, 1 ### the olive oil that came in first was actually a bottle of whole foods olive oil which had been oxidizing next to my stove for six months
5344, 1 ### japan is doing crazy things with toilets
5345, 1 ### and i want to get one of these
5346, 1 ### there's a little plaque on the end that you know each buyer gets their name engraved on it
5347, 1 ### i don't think it's that bad of a deal
5348, 0 ### now that's about all the videotape that remains of an event that set off the longest running mystery in the modern wine world
5349, 0 ### it finally began to get resolved in because of this guy
5350, 0 ### and it arrived and it was tiny
5352, 0 ### pei
5354, 0 ### and to try this i couldn't get a but i did go into the manhattan showroom of the manufacturer toto and they have a bathroom off of the showroom that you can use which i used
5355, 0 ### and blanc is kind of an unusual wine for bordeaux in having a significant percentage of the cabernet franc grape
5356, 0 ### so i'd about given up trying to get my hands on one of these
5357, 0 ### i went
5358, 0 ### and i wasn't that impressed
5359, 0 ### a lot of people you know said that they liked the more expensive wine more it was the same wine but they thought it was a different one that was more expensive
5362, 1 ### in in president estrada a million people each other about the corruption of that regime eventually brought it down and it was of course called the coup de text
5363, 1 ### i was sitting next to nelson mandela i was very privileged to do so when amy came onto the stage
5364, 1 ### my husband too has spent a long time in prison
5365, 0 ### this is neda the iranian girl who was shot while at a demonstration with her father in iran only a few weeks ago and she is now the focus rightly so of the generation
5366, 0 ### we now have the capacity to find common ground with people who we will never meet but who we will meet through the internet and through all the modern means of communication that we now have the capacity to organize and take collective action together to deal with the problem or an injustice that we want to deal with and i believe that this makes this a unique age in human history and it is the start of what i would call the creation of a truly global society
5367, 0 ### foreign policy can never be the same again
5370, 1 ### and i would stand at attention and all the girls would crack up and it was sort of a little joke
5371, 1 ### and he said i don't know who raised her but she's running the orphanage and she's been here three days
5373, 1 ### and i always thought that was a very annie hall kind of outfit
5374, 0 ### so i was so disturbed by what i saw and i was so unhappy with the article that ran afterwards that i decided i would take six months off
5375, 0 ### of course i was immediately intrigued
5377, 0 ### and what struck me immediately was how in love the two of these people were
5378, 1 ### what i didn't know though was most of those people standing there with me were moonies
5381, 0 ### and about years went by
5382, 1 ### and i feel like there's an uncomfortable tension in the room right now because i should not have worn this dress
5383, 1 ### if some of the women were really horrified when i came out you don't have to tell me now but i'll find out later on
5386, 1 ### very impressive
5387, 1 ### you could be the president of the united states or the inventor of the next internet or a ninja surgeon poet which would be awesome because you'd be the first one
5388, 0 ### and of course barring surgery or the fake tan that i got two days ago for work there's very little that we can do to transform how we look and how we look though it is superficial and immutable has a huge impact on our lives
5390, 0 ### this picture is the very first picture that i ever took and it's also the very first time that i had worn a bikini and i didn't even have my period yet
5392, 0 ### we say it's really amazing to travel and it's amazing to get to work with creative inspired passionate people
5393, 0 ### but i'm also happy and honored to be up here and i think that it's great that i got to come before or or years had passed and i'd had more agency in my career because maybe then i wouldn't tell the story of how i got my first job or maybe i wouldn't tell the story of how i paid for college which seems so important right now
5395, 1 ### my husband read it and he was like this is like eating your wheaties
5396, 1 ### and so she watched this ted talk and she went back the next day she took the job she went home and she handed her husband the grocery list
5397, 1 ### please raise your hand if you've been told you're too aggressive at work
5398, 1 ### if you're a woman please raise your hand if you've ever been told you're too aggressive at work
5399, 1 ### that little girl has executive leadership skills
5400, 1 ### and to them i say i'm not sorry at all
5401, 1 ### i've never met a man who's been asked how he does it all
5403, 0 ### so when we first started talking about maybe the subject wouldn't be social media which we assumed it would be but that you had very much on your mind the missing leadership positions particularly in the sector of technology and social media
5404, 0 ### and i talked to a bunch of people about should i give a speech at about women and they said oh no no
5407, 0 ### and part of my journey starting on this stage going to lean in going to the foundation is all about being more open and honest about those challenges so that other women can be more open and honest and all of us can work together towards real equality
5408, 0 ### so he could call evenly on men and women
5410, 0 ### it's so striking
5411, 0 ### he read the book
5412, 1 ### check out this video that maddie from my period three class sent me that evening
5413, 0 ### but if we place these technologies before student inquiry we can be robbing ourselves of our greatest tool as teachers our students' questions
5416, 1 ### it was supposed to break but that's okay
5417, 0 ### i just took this out of the kiln last week and the kiln itself takes another day or two to cool down but is really fast
5418, 1 ### and now his shoulder says wino forever
5419, 1 ### and by regretted it i mean that i stepped outside of the tattoo place this is just a couple miles from here down on the lower east side and i had a massive emotional meltdown in broad daylight on the corner of east broadway and canal street
5421, 1 ### million hits
5422, 0 ### i learned a lesson from it
5424, 0 ### so let's start off by defining some terms
5425, 0 ### and in fact the more we have of either of these things the more agency and the more imagination with respect to a given regret the more acute that regret will be
5426, 1 ### and i'm actually going to use his words in the same order that he did
5427, 1 ### those kinds of loose analogies with computers and with programming are actually much deeper than that
5428, 0 ### it felt wrong to do that in some way
5429, 0 ### when you're beginning to rot a little bit all of the videos crammed into your head all of the extensions that extend your various powers are going to being to seem a little secondary
5430, 1 ### i've left out error correction and a bunch of other things
5432, 0 ### so what we can do is actually tell you about the molecules but we don't really have a direct way of showing you the molecules
5433, 0 ### and he transformed our understanding of the moon
5435, 0 ### and i could see everybody looked at me somebody said
5436, 1 ### professor katey walter from the university of alaska went out with another team to another shallow lake last winter

5438, 1 ### leave that up to us
5439, 0 ### the permanent ice is marked in red
5440, 0 ### if you want to know how sea level rises from land base ice melting this is where it reaches the sea
5441, 0 ### percent of all the people in the world get half of their drinking water from that melting flow
5444, 1 ### you'd be surprised how many also told him that that was one more than he had in his head at various times
5445, 1 ### and i'd want one that could pass and would pass
5446, 1 ### that could and wouldn't and i've had some that would and could
5447, 1 ### i wanted them to be good inside too
5450, 0 ### then i ran across this simple verse that said at god's to confess a poor soul knelt and bowed his head
5453, 0 ### so i always liked it
5454, 0 ### and there a builder upward rise the arch of a church he builds wherein that minister may speak the word of god and lead a stumbling soul to touch the christ
5455, 0 ### i always tried to make the youngsters feel that they're there to get an education number one basketball was second because it was paying their way and they do need a little time for social activities but you let social activities take a little precedence over the other two and you're not going to have any very long
5458, 1 ### as a freelance journalist i sympathize
5459, 1 ### when you write about parasites your lexicon swells with phrases like devoured alive and bursts out of its body
5464, 0 ### this is a brine shrimp
5465, 0 ### only in a flamingo can the reproduce so to get there it manipulates its shrimp hosts into forming these conspicuous colored swarms that are easier for a flamingo to spot and to devour and that is the secret of the swarm
5469, 0 ### this discovery came out three weeks ago
5470, 1 ### one particularly dramatic case for a couple months i actually tried dosages and chemicals typical of a man in his early and i was blown away by how my thoughts changed
5472, 1 ### all of those a's
5474, 1 ### that's why is such a hit
5475, 1 ### and she was trying to frame her ex new girlfriend and i have to confess when i heard this i just reacted with admiration
5476, 0 ### i felt great
5477, 0 ### we know babies suffer from jealousy
5479, 0 ### i don't know what cat gut is but let's assume it's formidable
5482, 1 ### all right which means when it comes to perception we're all like this frog
5485, 1 ### if you're not sure that's a predator it's too late
5486, 1 ### it was completely new and no one had done it before including adults
5491, 1 ### right and the methods it says then we put the bees into the fridge smiley face
5493, 0 ### and yet the irony is the only way we can ever do anything new is to step into that space
5496, 0 ### so i took my bee arena down to a small school in devon and the aim of this was to not just get the kids to see science differently but through the process of science to see themselves differently
5497, 0 ### thank you beau
5501, 0 ### it's the only paper that will ever be freely accessible by this journal
5503, 0 ### my opportunity came in the form of beau and the bee project
5504, 1 ### to give you a sense of what that's like when my family went on vacation we had a bus
5505, 1 ### don't do that
5506, 0 ### now being the youngest of eight i learned a few survival skills
5507, 0 ### so i continued honing my skills
5508, 1 ### these were the first cloned calves the first cloned grey wolves and then finally the first cloned piglets alexis carrel janie and
5509, 1 ### so you may have thought that the creation of life was going to happen in something that looked like that
5510, 0 ### then human beings stepped out of the darwinian flow of evolutionary history and created the second great wave of evolution which was we changed the environment in which we evolved
5511, 0 ### now we actually have been doing it for a long time
5512, 1 ### we just don't do that although a night in the temple bar district can get pretty wild
5513, 1 ### now i don't know about you but i always feel like i find this or this inter dimensional portal
5514, 1 ### and of course we're all capable of understanding these symbols
5515, 1 ### now we've reached the subject of public transport and public transport here in dublin is a somewhat touchy subject
5516, 1 ### so i tried to make sense and when i arrived i was looking for some information leaflets that would help me crack this system and understand it and i found those brochures
5517, 1 ### say in the city center there were never actually any lines that showed the
5518, 1 ### there are actually not even any stations with names
5519, 0 ### he's part of this ethnic minority called the greeks
5521, 0 ### when we do however make a turn into a side street our mind tends to adjust that turn to a angle
5522, 0 ### and when you look at what you've just drawn you realize it does not resemble a street map
5523, 0 ### so here's what we did
5524, 0 ### any gaps that appeared in the outskirts were filled again
5525, 0 ### in this map i'm including each transport mode so rapid transport bus dart tram and the likes
5526, 1 ### so as somebody who has pretty close to the world record of total number of hours spent inside an scanner i can tell you that one of the skills that's really important for research is bladder control
5527, 1 ### that was a trip
5529, 0 ### it's called and it results from damage to a particular part of the brain
5530, 1 ### in it was viewed million times
5531, 1 ### because that's what you do when your name is yosemite mountain bear
5532, 1 ### and if you're wondering about those other spikes those are also fridays
5533, 1 ### even in the first seven days there was one parody for every other day of the week
5534, 1 ### and if you think that that is weird you should know that there is a three hour version of this that's been viewed four million times
5535, 0 ### but now web video has made it so that any of us or any of the creative things that we do can become completely famous in a part of our world's culture
5536, 0 ### bear vasquez oh my god
5537, 0 ### it's friday friday
5538, 0 ### it's been seen nearly million times this year
5539, 0 ### and these are not characteristics of old media and they're barely true of the media of today but they will define the entertainment of the future
5540, 1 ### people talk to me about the important new skill of making eye contact while you're
5541, 0 ### i embody the central paradox
5546, 1 ### i say it to remind you that as dumpy as i am it's coming from me it's like hearing a beautiful song from a busted old radio and it's nice of you to keep the radio around the house
5547, 0 ### anna smith famously said that there's a literature inside of each of us and three generations later i was part of a project called which set out to capture the stories of ordinary americans by setting up a booth in public spaces
5548, 1 ### my mom was freaking out my dad ran around to put out the fire and of course my sister started recording a video
5550, 1 ### but i like to say okay let's look at the modern human condition
5551, 1 ### it looks like this
5553, 0 ### and ed witten unleashed the second revolution
5555, 0 ### today the action is really around machine learning
5558, 1 ### i said no it's it's penguin shit
5561, 1 ### i'm not sure what these people think because i don't speak norsk
5563, 1 ### but if you get to play with all those knobs and dials and of course really the controller over there does it all on software you can make some terrific ribs
5565, 1 ### now i travel a lot and i change cell phones a lot and the one person who always gets updated on all my cell phones and pagers and everything else is jill because i really don't want to miss the call
5567, 1 ### there's a variety of things you can learn from watching whales have sex
5569, 1 ### the other interesting thing that i learned about whale sex they curl their toes too
5572, 0 ### there's many mysteries these statues
5573, 0 ### so this used to be completely smooth
5574, 0 ### while i was in easter island comet mcnaught was there also so you get a gratuitous picture of a with a comet
5577, 0 ### a is an artificial material which manipulates in this case electromagnetic radiation in a way that you couldn't otherwise
5578, 0 ### but are an incredibly exciting field
5580, 0 ### it turns out a it's useful and for a geek like me it's fun
5581, 0 ### so the jodie foster character here is actually this woman jill tarter and jill has dedicated her life to this
5582, 1 ### and so a couple of years back my cofounder and i were teaching university students just like these only the students we were teaching looked a little bit more like this here
5585, 0 ### and not only that now they could also understand even on a molecular level inside the machine what is happening to the machines
5586, 1 ### never ever think outside the box
5587, 0 ### so let me quickly try and tell you why i thought that and how i went about it
5588, 1 ### i tell people if it's in the news don't worry about it because by definition news is something that almost never happens
5589, 1 ### i could have taken him to new york and he would have died in a day
5590, 1 ### it basically never happens
5591, 1 ### but if you think about it if you are a hospital and you need to take a baby away from its mother out of the room to run some tests you better have some good security theater or she's going to rip your arm off
5592, 0 ### and what i want to do in this talk is to split them apart figuring out when they diverge and how they converge
5593, 0 ### you've heard in the past several years the world is safer because saddam hussein is not in power
5594, 0 ### and it'll depend on where we live whether we live alone or have a family how much cool stuff we have how much we're willing to accept the risk of theft
5595, 0 ### we often won't even notice them
5598, 1 ### humans and bonobos are the only animals that have sex face when both of them are alive
5599, 0 ### all right
5603, 1 ### the musicians hate them
5605, 0 ### the opera house had provided the wrong instrument
5606, 1 ### and of course the question is what are the biggest obstacles before you can go into human clinical trials the biggest obstacles are regulations
5607, 0 ### and that's probably the reason why i've chosen to be a functional neurosurgeon
5608, 1 ### they really do exist
5610, 1 ### unfortunately it's not practice footage because the thinks emergent technology is what happens when a submarine surfaces but we do what we can
5613, 0 ### go
5614, 1 ### now not you not this talk but that is generally true
5615, 1 ### now that's something i fall short of on a daily basis
5617, 0 ### we recognize patterns to distinguish noise from signal and especially our name
5619, 0 ### many people take refuge in headphones but they turn big public spaces like this shared into millions of tiny little personal sound bubbles
5620, 1 ### the nice thing about australians is that they're habitually used to looking at the world upside down
5621, 0 ### many of you might not know this but we happen to be celebrating the hundredth year of the introduction of antibiotics into the united states
5622, 1 ### imagine spending seven years at mit and research laboratories only to find out that you're a performance artist
5623, 0 ### chris has asked me to do a short performance and so i'm going to take just this time maybe minutes to do that and hopefully at the end have just a moment to show you a couple of my other projects in video form
5624, 1 ### every time you drink a glass of water he points out the odds are that you will imbibe at least one molecule that passed through the bladder of oliver cromwell
5626, 1 ### i want to give the name middle world to the medium scaled environment in which we've evolved the ability to take act nothing to do with middle earth middle world
5629, 1 ### have every reason to think it's true i was reading playboy because i myself had an article in it
5630, 1 ### but when we revert to being human we behave more like basil who we remember thrashed his car to teach it a lesson when it wouldn't start on gourmet night
5631, 1 ### personification and the of intentional purpose is such a brilliantly successful way to model humans it's hardly surprising the same modeling software often seizes control when we're trying to think about entities for which it's not appropriate like basil with his car or like millions of deluded people with the universe as a whole
5632, 0 ### this means that quantum theory has got to be in some sense true
5634, 0 ### we never evolved to navigate in the world of atoms
5636, 0 ### in the same way our lives are dominated by gravity but are almost oblivious to the force of surface tension
5637, 0 ### but we find real matter comforting only because we've evolved to survive in middle world where matter is a useful fiction
5638, 0 ### steve grand points out that you and i are ourselves more like a wave than a permanent thing
5639, 0 ### whatever you are therefore you are not the stuff of which you are made
5640, 1 ### i don't want you to see what i'm doing up here
5641, 1 ### in fact it appeared in a porno comic book which is the slide on the right
5642, 1 ### i couldn't deal with the success of furniture i wasn't secure enough as an architect and so i closed it all up and made furniture that nobody would like
5643, 1 ### and after we failed i just kept failing
5644, 1 ### i got into fish
5645, 1 ### and after i got i was really drunk i was asked to do some sketches on napkins
5646, 1 ### three weeks later i received a complete set of drawings saying we'd won the competition
5647, 1 ### so
5648, 1 ### and the next night we had fish
5649, 1 ### it was a joke
5652, 1 ### the only thing i did was i made it possible for them to turn those blades so you could sail this thing in the canal because i love sailing
5653, 1 ### he didn't recommend me by the way
5654, 1 ### the health club is fastened to the garage with a c clamp for cleveland
5655, 1 ### and then i do it
5656, 1 ### we finally settled on a shape that was the proportion of the with the sloping outside walls which the said were crucial to this and later decided they weren't but now we have them
5657, 1 ### and so it will be quite a different shape
5658, 1 ### and i was asked to do a fish and so i did a snake
5659, 1 ### we showed this to the hotel people the other day and they were terrified and said that nobody would come to the ritz carlton anymore because of this fish
5660, 0 ### and then i did a law school for loyola in downtown l
5661, 0 ### and so the whole idea here was to create that kind of space in downtown in a neighborhood that was difficult to fit into
5663, 0 ### so i decided to cut off the head and the tail
5664, 0 ### and i'm always drawn to that
5665, 0 ### of course the milk can is his
5666, 0 ### and one day i had a oh well the other way
5667, 0 ### i use a lot of metal in my work and i have a hard time connecting with the craft
5668, 0 ### i was given an opportunity to design an exhibit for the unions of america and canada in washington and i did it on the condition that they become my partners in the future and help me with all future metal buildings etc
5669, 0 ### and herman miller has this philosophy of having a place a people place
5670, 0 ### and they end up looking like stone
5671, 0 ### and so stanley did the little dome thing
5672, 0 ### and so i decided to put him in a depression
5673, 0 ### in boston we had that old building on the left
5674, 0 ### in barcelona on las for some film festival i did the hollywood sign going and coming made a building out of it and they built it
5675, 0 ### i just joined the points
5676, 0 ### and we started with the stream and built the house along the stream dammed it up to make a lake
5677, 0 ### and so we finally ended up making it
5678, 0 ### in this case we learned how to detail it
5680, 1 ### he's at home having tea
5681, 0 ### the second reason is we cannot keep doing animal experimentation forever and we have to embody all our data and all our knowledge into a working model
5682, 1 ### was fatter than a telephone directory busy pumping hot air into the bubble
5685, 1 ### it's the mental equivalent of the full body massage
5686, 1 ### you're going to have to fuck up really badly to make it bad
5687, 0 ### i mean it had to
5688, 0 ### it was at the same ted two years ago when richard and i reached an agreement on the future of ted
5691, 0 ### there's a year to do this and already i hope to show you a bit later there's or so terrific speakers signed up for next year
5692, 1 ### yes it's a little boring but some people kind of get into the zen of it
5693, 0 ### one is what's on the boston public library
5694, 1 ### later when this chapter appeared in our textbooks our biology teacher skipped the subject
5696, 1 ### he was astonished to know that girls get painful cramps and we bleed every month
5697, 1 ### parents and teachers were comfortable in talking about periods to young girls using the book and sometimes even boys were interested in reading it
5698, 1 ### so please be period positive
5700, 0 ### and in some parts of this number is as high as nine out of girls being unaware of it
5701, 0 ### so when i started getting my periods i began with using rags
5702, 0 ### i was not allowed to touch or eat pickles
5703, 0 ### and in the absence of any intervention it is the myth and misconception that propagate from generation to generation
5705, 1 ### as adam smith said no man ever saw a dog make a fair exchange of a bone with another dog
5706, 1 ### they made his silly outfits like this and they did his silly or whatever
5707, 1 ### it's the one thing we insist on doing for ourselves is reproduction
5709, 0 ### one is an hand axe from half a million years ago of the kind made by homo
5710, 0 ### it just tells you they were both designed to fit the human hand
5711, 0 ### and there's another difference too which is the object on the left is made from one substance
5714, 1 ### jim was
5716, 1 ### i'm sorry to say that
5717, 1 ### i suggested we should have occupy death
5719, 0 ### i don't promise anything
5723, 0 ### this is john hunter hospital
5724, 0 ### and if that wasn't bad enough of course all of this is rapidly progressing towards the fact that many of you in fact about one in of you at this point will die in intensive care
5726, 1 ### i've never been so nervous and i do this when i'm nervous i just realized
5727, 1 ### all these people that had sort of flexible daily hours and an interest in the english word i hope to have an interest in the english language but i'm not speaking it well right now
5728, 1 ### and we looked around and somebody else said well you should sell supplies to the working buccaneer
5730, 1 ### the only problem especially for the adults working at who hadn't necessarily bought into all of this when they signed up was that there was just the one bathroom
5733, 1 ### you can see the time in all five boroughs of new york in the back
5734, 1 ### the echo park time travel mart whenever you are we're already then
5736, 0 ### my mom was a teacher my sister became a teacher and after college so many of my friends went into teaching
5738, 0 ### it used to be in my kitchen in brooklyn
5739, 0 ### so we rented this space
5741, 0 ### these are some signs that we have all over the place practical joking with pirates
5744, 0 ### you know it's been proven that to hours a year with one attention a student can get one grade level higher
5745, 0 ### but there was something psychological happening there that was just a little bit different
5746, 1 ### without flowering plants there would be no clever fruit eating primates giving ted talks
5747, 1 ### they're a great model for flies
5748, 1 ### i think we have to compare we have to compare the size of the brain with what the brain can do
5749, 1 ### and then something happened when i started to work on flies
5750, 1 ### so at least you'll admit that if fruit flies are not as clever as mice they're at least as clever as pigeons
5751, 0 ### now i have carefully cropped this sequence to be exactly the duration of a human eye blink so in the time that it would take you to blink your eye the fly has seen this looming predator estimated its position initiated a motor pattern to fly it away beating its wings at times a second as it does so
5752, 0 ### well the problem was in thinking that the insect wings function in the way that aircraft wings work
5754, 0 ### they have antennae that sense odors and detect wind detection
5755, 0 ### one of the most sophisticated sensors a fly has is a structure called the
5756, 1 ### and the other cool thing is not only can we move the camera around we can also control time so i can slide this jog dial here to shuttle time forward and now we can see what a sunset on the would look like and they get one every minutes
5759, 0 ### we go from this view out to the stars
5764, 1 ### it had to have a rider and it had to participate in cavalry charges
5765, 1 ### and we sent it off to the national theatre hoping that they believed that we created something that worked
5766, 1 ### here is the plan
5767, 1 ### you see the string tendon from the hyena the front leg automatically pulls the hoop up
5769, 0 ### his mother was a puppeteer
5771, 0 ### so this production was seen by tom morris of the national theatre in london
5772, 0 ### so we made a model
5773, 0 ### this is in the national theatre studio the place where they cook new ideas
5774, 1 ### you're going to find some interesting analogies in this physiology
5775, 1 ### she's just laid it down nice and tidy
5777, 0 ### and not enough is being done about this
5778, 0 ### and one of the things that you see is that male line the mortality is going down down down down down
5779, 0 ### heart disease kills more women at all ages than breast cancer
5780, 1 ### we seem to be fixated on this romanticized idea that every poor peasant in africa is an entrepreneur
5781, 1 ### but why pan african the scramble for africa during the berlin conference of where quite frankly we africans were not exactly consulted resulted in massive fragmentation and many sovereign states with small populations liberia four million cape verde
5782, 0 ### consider these two alternative scenarios
5783, 0 ### we hope to aid this fight for economic freedom by building world class businesses creating indigenous wealth providing jobs that we so desperately need and hopefully helping achieve this
5787, 1 ### we work in groups in big cities and in small villages
5788, 1 ### the one i liked the best is someone could download my sequence go back to the lab synthesize some fake ellen and plant it at a crime scene
5791, 0 ### we make things grow
5793, 0 ### now it could happen but i'm not going to plan my life around it
5798, 1 ### and this seems like a tall order especially if you want a succulent tomato
5799, 1 ### not moose but water
5804, 1 ### if you have a compass on venus and mars congratulations you're lost
5806, 0 ### so venus is too hot mars is too cold and earth is just right
5808, 0 ### here's one of my favorite pictures of mars
5811, 0 ### the magnetic field may gather energy from the solar wind that allows even more atmospheric escape to happen
5812, 0 ### so i've posed a problem for you here but i don't have a solution yet
5814, 1 ### now visualize a pack of overweight on bicycles
5815, 1 ### this was a bunch of guys and a few ladies widely varying in both age and upkeep
5816, 1 ### it will prove to the world that anybody can do this
5817, 1 ### we spent an afternoon together in the salt lake city public library memorizing phone books which was
5818, 1 ### he used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of random binary digits in half an hour
5819, 1 ### so how does this work let's say that you've been invited to ted center stage to give a speech and you want to do it from memory and you want to do it the way that cicero would have done it if he had been invited to years ago
5820, 1 ### and you'd come up with some sort of crazy ridiculous unforgettable image to remind you that the first thing you want to talk about is this totally bizarre contest
5821, 1 ### the problem was that a memory contest is a pathologically boring event
5822, 1 ### this is me wearing my standard competitive training kit
5824, 0 ### step over the threshold of your door into your foyer your hallway whatever's on the other side and appreciate the quality of the light
5825, 0 ### walk past him into your living room
5826, 0 ### these people must be freaks of nature
5827, 0 ### we've all trained ourselves to perform these utterly miraculous feats of memory using a set of ancient techniques techniques invented years ago in greece the same techniques that cicero had used to memorize his speeches that medieval scholars had used to memorize entire books
5828, 0 ### this is a guy called e
5829, 0 ### these technologies have made our modern world possible but they've also changed us
5832, 0 ### it is entirely from all of the other memories floating around in your skull
5833, 0 ### the entire art of what is going on in these memory contests and the entire art of remembering stuff better in everyday life is figuring out ways to transform capital b bakers into lower case b bakers to take information that is lacking in context in significance in meaning and transform it in some way so that it becomes meaningful in the light of all the other things that you have in your mind
5839, 1 ### i said i'd be there in about two years
5840, 1 ### all the students sat around and they went
5841, 1 ### my sister said maybe i should leave you alone because you seem to be doing a lot better when not saying anything
5842, 1 ### and as i walked off a little bit they'd say yeah and shut up too
5843, 0 ### and i could see my father yeah he really is crazy
5844, 0 ### and it was a big thing in my little community of point reyes station in inverness california because there were only about people there in the winter this was back in now

5870, 1 ### okay
5872, 0 ### so we just switch off us governments and aid agencies
5873, 0 ### that really stuck with me
5874, 0 ### so that's definitely going to get through those holes

5878, 1 ### you know i am so bad at tech that my daughter who is now when she was five was overheard by me to say to a friend of hers if it doesn't bleed when you cut it my daddy doesn't understand it
5879, 1 ### of course in this day and age the trick is not to let each tree be obscured by that bush in washington that can get can get in the way
5880, 0 ### it's this is what i have done because i'm excited by it because it's a wonderful thing and it's done something for me and of course it's accomplished a great deal

5903, 1 ### i have some material about the so called radical gay agenda which starts off by asking how radical is the gay agenda because from what i can tell the three things gay americans seem to want most are to join the military get married and start a family
5906, 0 ### now comedy travels along a distinct wavelength from other forms of language
5907, 0 ### which in my experience means communication that manages to speak to and expand our concept of self interest
5908, 0 ### it just so happens that stewart's brand of funny doesn't work unless the facts are true

5924, 0 ### through cultural changes our ancestors largely eliminated early death so that people can now live out their full lives
5926, 0 ### but at no point does it return to the levels we see in early adulthood

6064, 0 ### i'm not here to argue against science and math
6066, 0 ### now the reason i say this is because one of the effects of the current culture here if i can say so has been to de professionalize teachers
6067, 0 ### and part of the problem is i think that the dominant culture of education has come to focus on not teaching and learning but testing
6069, 0 ### now we only know that's what they do well at because that's all that's being tested
6071, 0 ### they recognize that you can't improve education if you don't pick great people to teach and keep giving them constant support and professional development
6072, 0 ### the trouble is that education doesn't go on in the committee rooms of our legislative buildings

6177, 0 ### i ended up starting this research and education station in which you are all of course invited to visit
6178, 1 ### also in the bible one sees that the death penalty was the accepted punishment for crimes such as homosexuality adultery blasphemy idolatry talking back to your parents and picking up sticks on the sabbath
6179, 1 ### president clinton if you're here thank you
6180, 1 ### there are dynamics in the opinion and advocacy markets no one ever attracted observers advocates and donors by saying things just seem to be getting better and better

6194, 1 ### and this is her getting the world record in real time
6195, 1 ### so we decided to test this in the lab
6196, 0 ### now you may reason that we have one to perceive the world or to think and that's completely wrong
6197, 0 ### there's one other way and that's through sweating
6201, 1 ### so i'll just give you my message up front try not to go extinct
6205, 1 ### you'd have a big dinosaur and a littler dinosaur
6206, 1 ### everybody likes to have their own animal that they named
6207, 0 ### so that's sort of the theme big different and gone
6209, 0 ### and it's kind of cool if you look at the cassowary or any of the birds that have crests on their heads they grow to about percent adult size before the crest starts to grow
6210, 0 ### but the actual at percent had no crest at all
6212, 0 ### but no one ever considered that they might be more closely related
6213, 0 ### it's got a little tiny dome and it's got a bunch of gnarly stuff on its nose
6216, 1 ### and so that's a masterpiece which is a fake of a masterpiece and bonded into the canvas is a chip which identifies that as a real fake if you see what i mean
6218, 1 ### and whenever i go to america and i have to pay with a mag stripe on the back of the card i always sign it carlos tethers anyway just as a security mechanism because if a transaction ever gets disputed and it comes back and it says dave birch i know it must have been a criminal because i would never sign it dave birch
6219, 1 ### and children i'm very proud of that picture that's my son playing in his band with his friends for the first ever gig i believe you call it where he got paid
6221, 1 ### i look pretty good in a suit frankly so you can see why it would drive them into an anti capitalist frenzy

6224, 1 ### i know that things are actually worse than these guys think
6225, 1 ### so i should say for some of our foreign visitors doctor who is the greatest living scientist in england and a beacon of truth and enlightenment to all of us
6226, 1 ### that means something i don't know what
6227, 0 ### and so what i thought i'd do is i'll explain four sort of problems about it and then i'll suggest a solution which hopefully you might find interesting
6228, 0 ### that chip and pin card that's in your pocket has a little chip on it that cost millions of pounds to develop is extremely secure you can put scanning electron microscopes on it you can try and grind it down blah blah blah
6229, 0 ### they were at the bottom of the menu they were like fifth i thought they had no chance
6230, 0 ### so you have this odd sort of paradox where i'm happy for him to go into this space if i know who everybody else is but i don't want anybody else to know who he is
6231, 0 ### and i read this story about cheerleaders and it's a fascinating story
6234, 0 ### and you can have an identity you don't like it because it's subverted in some way or it's insecure or it's inappropriate you just delete it and get another one
6235, 0 ### there's no point in sending that message
6239, 1 ### so the senior citizens realized that they needed to have an emergency meeting
6240, 1 ### and then the next thing that i needed was a makeover
6241, 1 ### so out went the green and in came the polyester and floral prints
6242, 1 ### but i did say no to the blue hair
6243, 1 ### so they were teaching me cuss word scrabble at night
6244, 0 ### i was running across the street and the only thing that i actually remember is feeling like a grenade went off in my head
6245, 0 ### i ended up with blunt chest trauma
6246, 0 ### somehow i ended up at the hospital
6247, 0 ### that's another story we won't even get into
6249, 0 ### so i got going on it
6250, 1 ### with my new venture marilyn i would like to use art to create tech
6251, 1 ### i actually have no idea what my robot is going to do today
6252, 1 ### yet
6253, 0 ### i think he's going to be super popular
6254, 0 ### he gasps to the operator my friend is dead
6256, 1 ### i think it all started growing up in a fairly religious moral family eldest son of a rabbi going off to university where i smoked some marijuana and i liked it
6257, 1 ### it's going to be people in their and and who find they prefer a little marijuana to that drink in the evening or the sleeping pill or that it helps with their arthritis or diabetes or maybe helps spice up a long term marriage
6259, 0 ### so think about our global drug war not as any sort of rational policy but as the international projection of a domestic psychosis
6260, 1 ### apparently i was in charge of making sure that no one stole the computers from the university
6261, 1 ### the most ridiculous thing i ever heard is i was at a dinner party and a woman heard that i work in computer security and she asked me if she said her computer had been infected by a virus and she was very concerned that she might get sick from it that she could get this virus
6262, 1 ### so one question the researchers asked themselves is could you block this thing right could you run a denial because these are first responders so would a terrorist organization want to black out the ability of police and fire to communicate at an emergency they found that there's this device used for that happens to operate at the same exact frequency as the and they built what they called my first jammer
6263, 0 ### now medical devices have come a long way technologically
6264, 0 ### now what a research team did was they got their hands on what's called an
6265, 0 ### and they were able to change therapies including disabling the device and this is with a real commercial off device simply by performing reverse engineering and sending wireless signals to it
6267, 1 ### she's a year older than me and that's something that if she's still playing i know i can play
6271, 1 ### but they say when it comes to losing you are very very very bad at it
6276, 0 ### i wasn't quite sure what to think but i just knew that at that moment it was really important for me to just focus right there at the australian open and i was definitely not sure what to do
6277, 0 ### thank you
6278, 0 ### you hear all these stories about people when they're pregnant they get sick and they get tired
6281, 0 ### so not only not only did he have rude things to say about me and my peers i felt it was important for us to stand up for each other and to stand up for myself
6282, 1 ### here's the current training model
6283, 1 ### and what surgeons do is they stick a scope into the pepper and they do what is called a
6286, 0 ### as you look on the top side of this that's where the heart and lungs are supposed to be
6287, 0 ### i work with surgical teams
6288, 1 ### in case you're finished with toilet paper you can tear off the inside of the wall
6290, 1 ### and also i still remember we were expecting to have a beer inside the plastic beer crate but it came empty
6292, 0 ### it's a very popular museum now and i created a big monument for the government
6293, 0 ### but i must say they are no longer natural disasters
6296, 1 ### there's no such thing
6297, 1 ### and i'm more of the life's messy clean it up organize it and put it into a bento box
6299, 1 ### as you know it's not going to turn out well
6301, 1 ### which actually looked more like this
6302, 1 ### i call it a breakdown my therapist calls it a spiritual awakening
6304, 1 ### don't bring your measuring stick
6305, 1 ### meters are good
6306, 1 ### and i said but here's the thing no family stuff no childhood shit
6309, 0 ### but i want to be able to make them not messy
6311, 0 ### i'm not thin enough rich enough beautiful enough smart enough promoted enough
6312, 0 ### and i kind of got a handle on it
6314, 0 ### so i wrote at the top of the manila folder and i started looking at the data
6315, 0 ### and i want to separate courage and bravery for you for a minute
6316, 0 ### they didn't talk about vulnerability being comfortable nor did they really talk about it being excruciating as i had heard it earlier in the shame interviewing
6319, 0 ### one of the things that i think we need to think about is why and how we numb
6320, 0 ### just certain
6321, 0 ### that's not our job
6322, 0 ### we do that corporate whether it's a bailout an oil spill
6324, 1 ### that's what wired magazine spent on this
6325, 0 ### you're looking at things where people are actually given information and they're not following through with it
6326, 1 ### it's years of it that's created what i call the baba factor
6327, 1 ### there won't be a single moment in the schedule
6328, 1 ### you're obviously a criminal so i'm going to install cameras
6330, 0 ### and that makes me really sad because i'm sick and tired of things not working
6332, 0 ### last
6334, 1 ### so i call them gandhi neurons or empathy neurons
6335, 0 ### and this is truly the most amazing thing in the world
6336, 1 ### what we found was that password meters do work
6337, 1 ### it's called security blanket
6338, 0 ### at carnegie mellon they used to make it actually pretty easy for us to remember our passwords
6340, 1 ### and since you don't know me as the woman walking around ted in her underwear that means i found a few things
6341, 1 ### it is almost physiologically impossible to be in a bad mood when you're wearing bright red pants
6344, 1 ### and as a result she wore an i heart my vagina button to her high school in minnesota
6345, 1 ### so what she did is she got all her friends together i believe it was students all wore i love my vagina t shirts and the boys wore i love her vagina t shirts to school
6347, 0 ### we all get sick
6348, 1 ### so when i ask you a question since i'm blind only raise your hand if you want to burn off some calories
6349, 1 ### is that all all right let me show you some more about this
6351, 1 ### the one on the left is jazz and the one on the right is swing but you know what this is a highly useless categorization scheme
6352, 0 ### and they found that the average engaged in about tasks in a week
6353, 0 ### they had different kinds of mustards and vinegars and over different kinds of fruits and vegetables and more than two dozen different kinds of bottled water and this was during a time when we actually used to drink tap water
6354, 0 ### here's their jam aisle
6355, 0 ### of the people who stopped when there were only three percent of them actually bought a jar of jam
6356, 1 ### here's an example of a project they made a motion activated confetti canon ball
6357, 1 ### it's a lobster made of that's afraid of the dark
6358, 0 ### almost a hundred years later in lego came up with this
6359, 0 ### meanwhile the exact same year at bell labs the next revolution was about to be announced the next building block
6360, 1 ### it reminds me a bit of high school unfortunately
6361, 0 ### but i'm actually standing here today amazingly to tell you that not only is the sequencing of extinct a possibility actually a modern day reality but the revival of an extinct species is actually within reach maybe not from the insects in amber in fact this mosquito was actually used for the inspiration for jurassic park but from woolly mammoths the well preserved remains of woolly mammoths in the
6363, 1 ### they look somewhat similar but they mean very different things
6364, 1 ### so the best way to demonstrate how this technology works is to try a live demo so i need a volunteer preferably somebody with a face
6365, 1 ### yep awesome
6366, 1 ### try to remember what it was like when left one direction
6367, 1 ### between men and women
6368, 0 ### i started on this path years ago
6369, 0 ### in emotion science we call each facial muscle movement an action unit
6370, 0 ### and then eyebrow raised indicator of surprise
6371, 0 ### but we call each reading an emotion data point and then they can fire together to portray different emotions
6373, 0 ### the more people who know about this technology the more we can all have a voice in how it's being used
6374, 1 ### not you but i feel this way often
6387, 0 ### and so we're on one planet and we have to be able to get to the root of these problems
6388, 1 ### i feel like a fish out of water or maybe an owl out of the air
6392, 1 ### i have phlebitis at the moment in both legs and that's the reason that i had to have a little help in getting up here because i have parkinson's disease in addition to that and some other problems that i won't talk about
6393, 1 ### he didn't have a doctor's degree because he said nobody was qualified to give him one
6394, 0 ### and he was slapping the stewardess and pinching her as she went by and everybody was upset with him
6396, 0 ### now instead of crude tools made of sticks and stones israel now had iron plows and sickles and hoes and military weapons
6399, 0 ### we find ourselves in the paralyzing grip of self destructive habits we can't break
6400, 1 ### and he turned to me and he said carne you have to be very clever to be a diplomat
6401, 1 ### i was a single british diplomat in new york city you can imagine what that might have meant
6402, 0 ### i don't believe in straightforward narratives
6403, 0 ### i loved watching planes barrel over our holiday home in the countryside
6404, 1 ### what you can see here is the german age pyramid and there the small black point at the top that's me
6407, 1 ### this is a more sophisticated version of it depends
6409, 0 ### highly speculative
6410, 0 ### now to close the gap germany has to significantly increase migration get many more women in the workforce increase retirement age by the way we just lowered it this year and all these measures at once
6413, 1 ### so that is how in case there are people here in the audience who would like to try this is how not to learn wire walking
6414, 1 ### but the bird instead of flying away goes flop flop flop and lands on my head
6415, 1 ### but the dove who obviously didn't go to flying school goes flop flop flop and ends up at the end of my balancing pole
6416, 1 ### what a genius what a professional
6417, 0 ### okay i cheated it was a mere seconds
6418, 0 ### now that manipulation was broken down into seven moves described over seven pages
6419, 0 ### the magician looked at me and said this is a disaster
6420, 0 ### passion is the motto of all my actions
6422, 1 ### i should tell you some stories about remarkable people so i thought i'd start with my mother
6428, 1 ### and so this woman emptied out her suitcase and gave all of her clothes to my mother and to us and the toys of her kids who didn't like that very much but that was the only time she cried
6429, 1 ### of course talking about goats makes me think of sheep and not in good ways
6430, 1 ### i'm sure he thought i'd take a book or a shirt but i found an inflatable sheep
6432, 0 ### so it wasn't just me there was a whole generation of us
6436, 0 ### anyway a goat's eyes are like a child's eyes
6439, 0 ### and their wish would then be brought to a priest who would find a ritual object and the appropriate sacrifices would be made and the shrine would be built for the god
6440, 0 ### there are some of you in this room amazing people who offer all of us the mirror to our own humanity
6442, 1 ### is the most common term
6443, 0 ### carlos had post traumatic stress disorder
6444, 1 ### meet your cousin thalia democratica
6445, 1 ### but this is not a self aggrandizing enterprise because in this type of discovery research if you don't feel like a complete idiot most of the time you're just not hard enough
6446, 1 ### in this of life and biodiversity we occupy a rather unremarkable position
6447, 1 ### but like all good magicians they're not really releasing their secrets readily to me
6449, 0 ### here barely two miles away from what is arguably the greatest marine biology lab in the world we lower a simple plankton net into the water and bring up to the surface things that humanity rarely pays any attention to and oftentimes has never seen before
6450, 0 ### but this emphasis today on forcing biological research to specialize and to produce practical outcomes is actually restricting our ability to interrogate life to unacceptably narrow confines and unsatisfying depths
6451, 0 ### i think it's very safe to say that we don't even know how much about life we do not know
6452, 0 ### this little guy right here three nobel prizes in years
6454, 1 ### so in other words i need to tell you everything i learned at medical school
6456, 0 ### and the numbers here are really rather staggering
6458, 1 ### who knows maybe she was volunteering for service
6459, 1 ### i was waiting for an audible pedestrian signal and as it went off i was just about to step out into the street when all of a sudden my right hand was just gripped by this guy and he yanked my arm and pulled me out into the crosswalk and was dragging me out across the street speaking to me in mandarin
6460, 1 ### i didn't get that sighted
6461, 1 ### in fact cars who needs them if you're blind you don't drive
6462, 0 ### stepping onto the sidewalk i then heard the sound of a steel chair slide across the concrete sidewalk in front of me
6463, 0 ### on the third day it was gone
6464, 0 ### my son still had his dad
6465, 0 ### it was a lot of hard work
6467, 1 ### after there is the narcissistic design it's a fantastic designer who designs only for other fantastic designers
6469, 1 ### fin
6470, 1 ### i am not sure of that
6473, 0 ### the big challenge in front of us
6474, 0 ### the most stupid bacteria
6475, 0 ### ok that means we are at half of the story
6477, 1 ### and that's the reason i beat him actually because i respected him
6481, 1 ### i want to stay in the now with the young people i don't want to get behind
6484, 1 ### and they go oh billie they cannot focus
6486, 1 ### she gets a text from one of the workers like an intern she's just starting she goes oh by the way i'm going to be late because i'm at the
6487, 1 ### she goes ok
6488, 1 ### no problem pm now billie that story i know but that's what scares the boomers i'm just telling you so i think it's good for us to share
6489, 1 ### my poor parents did not care if we were any good
6491, 0 ### so we really wanted to break away from that
6492, 0 ### and that changed everything
6493, 0 ### and now i have two daughters and it has made a difference in how i raise them
6494, 0 ### and that tennis if i was fortunate enough to become number one and i knew being a girl it would be harder to have influence already at that age that i had this platform
6497, 0 ### but what you're talking about is even bigger than that
6500, 0 ### so i think you have to ask yourself i want people to be themselves whatever that is just let it be
6501, 0 ### and that was in the old days with philip morris with virginia slims and this is the second time in my entire life
6505, 1 ### my lower half is appearing at a different conference in a different country
6506, 1 ### they called me the girl with the beard
6508, 1 ### i'm sorry to laugh here but you do look so different than you did in haight ashbury in the
6509, 1 ### so this is what i hope that you will do if i could be so bold and not have it deducted from my number of wishes
6510, 1 ### you see if this is true and i believe it is that the digital world you all created has the creative imagination from the physical constraints of matter this should be a piece of piss
6511, 1 ### most of them impossible some of them impractical and one or two of them certainly immoral
6512, 0 ### the revolution this revolution is much bigger than that
6514, 0 ### and that's actually what i'd like to talk about today
6515, 0 ### ethiopia didn't just blow my mind it opened my mind
6516, 0 ### that's an emergency
6518, 0 ### that's right
6519, 0 ### you see africa makes a fool of our idea of justice
6520, 1 ### so i was excited then i panicked then i was excited then i panicked and in between the excitement and the panicking i started to do my research and my research primarily consisted of how to give a great ted talk
6521, 1 ### it's the talk that i would have given if i had been famous first
6522, 1 ### you know and you know like she's african and i'm african and she's a feminist and i'm a feminist and she's a storyteller and i'm a storyteller so i really felt like it's my talk
6527, 0 ### stories are the antidote to bias
6529, 0 ### quite the contrary
6530, 0 ### but you didn't
6534, 1 ### and the laptop was running windows
6535, 1 ### percent for those of you keeping score yes the number is very close to
6536, 1 ### we're like the peace corps for nerds but instead of traveling to crazy interesting far off places you spend a lot of time indoors behind computers helping restore the fabric of our democracy
6538, 0 ### and the inability of her to do that same work from her couch means that she might be having to take days or hours off of work that she can't spare
6539, 0 ### which is quite frankly why government needs to get its shit together and catch up
6540, 1 ### so in order to make this white noise a little bit active and reactive i create a ball a rolling ball able to analyze and find where does aggressive sound come from and roll at home or at work towards aggressive noise and emits white noise in order to neutralize it
6541, 1 ### and turning around you is like that
6543, 1 ### so a huge problem
6544, 1 ### and he told me after a long silence i wonder mathieu if people won't be more fascinated by your benches than by my videos
6545, 1 ### sorry for that
6546, 1 ### he would be so afraid
6547, 0 ### it's you
6548, 0 ### and it really helps me to understand how we see how we hear how we breathe how our brain can inform or mislead us
6549, 0 ### what could be our real needs maybe the silence
6550, 0 ### i just wanted to using the complexity and the technology of the brain of the human brain
6552, 0 ### i don't want to create a perfect object like a perfect robot
6553, 0 ### and they react
6554, 1 ### we had a two old baby in the house that was ours we hadn't taken it from somebody else
6556, 1 ### there's some theoretical physicist at mit named steven johnson who has dropped two spots i'm happy to say
6557, 1 ### our good friend chris has about a six percent but with a bullet i might add
6558, 1 ### no that's not true
6561, 1 ### right at the center of the reagan years that's we're there's we've it's
6562, 0 ### there were no cars so it seemed even better in some ways
6563, 0 ### if they did it probably was right there at ground zero
6565, 0 ### the whole system kind of working on it and everybody contributing a small little part
6567, 0 ### now they're more innovative well pretty innovative but there are some new twists on this
6568, 0 ### this is what they think about my site it's ranked by authority
6570, 1 ### a squirrel is chewing on your internet
6571, 1 ### it was unequivocally not something a squirrel could chew on
6573, 1 ### we've only communicated via this system which always makes me think of him as the man inside the internet
6574, 1 ### the undersea cable industry is dominated by englishmen and they all seem to be
6575, 1 ### and he said there was coming soon depending on the weather but he'd let me know when and so with about four days notice he said to go to this beach south of lisbon and a little after this guy will walk out of the water
6576, 1 ### and then once it was in the right place he got back in the water holding a big knife and he cut each buoy off and the buoy popped up into the air and the cable dropped to the sea floor and he did that all the way out to the ship and when he got there they gave him a glass of juice and a cookie and then he jumped back in and he swam back to shore and then he lit a cigarette
6577, 0 ### you can experience their sense of place
6578, 0 ### if you went and looked for images of the internet this was all that you found this famous image by of the internet as the kind of milky way this infinite expanse where we don't seem to be anywhere on it
6580, 0 ### and i was embarrassed
6581, 0 ### and that connection is an unequivocally physical process
6582, 0 ### if the internet is a global phenomenon if we live in a global village it's because there are cables underneath the ocean cables like this
6584, 1 ### when applying makeup i borrow a sniper's method to better protect myself and to detect the enemy as he did
6586, 1 ### interpreter this one is called instant noodles
6588, 0 ### this piece is called the studio
6589, 0 ### so i tried to make my eyes bigger with my fingers
6590, 1 ### when i was my parents bought me a chemistry set and i decided to make water
6592, 1 ### the gentleman to my left is the very famous perhaps overly famous frank gehry
6595, 1 ### it was intuitive
6597, 1 ### liquid architecture
6598, 1 ### it's not his money of course
6599, 1 ### i was so proud
6600, 1 ### but you've got to yeah well up until then every building leaked so this
6602, 0 ### but that's an interesting thing for a creative person
6603, 0 ### i've never really gone out looking for work
6604, 0 ### i think it was circumstantial
6605, 0 ### for me every day is a new thing
6609, 0 ### i mean charlie moore did a bunch of it but it didn't feel good to me
6612, 0 ### and i think everybody i mean that should be a matter of fact like gravity
6613, 0 ### usually i say no right away but some of them come with pedigree and they sound well intentioned and they get you for at least one or two meetings
6615, 0 ### lightweight
6616, 1 ### most of you will be happy to know that the rest of the free
6618, 1 ### after all there's a strong correlation between water and fishing and for some there's a strong correlation between fishing and beer
6619, 0 ### on this map the colored areas represent water conflicts
6621, 0 ### but as more people showed up wanting water the folks who were there first got a little concerned and in montana passed its first water law
6622, 1 ### i want to discuss with you this afternoon why you're going to fail to have a great career
6623, 1 ### you're going to fail too
6626, 1 ### when i was five i thought i was a genius but my professors have beaten that idea out of my head long since
6629, 1 ### won't happen and you will die alone
6630, 1 ### let us merge our interests
6631, 1 ### although he did make a note to himself that the next time he proposed it was perhaps not necessary to enumerate all of the women he had auditioned for the part
6632, 1 ### but what that tombstone should have said in an alternative lifetime what it should have said if it was your highest expression of talent was here lies the last nobel laureate in physics who formulated the grand unified field theory and demonstrated the practicality of warp drive
6635, 0 ### we're going to go through a whole long list your creativity in thinking of excuses not to do what you really need to do if you want to have a great career
6637, 0 ### so if you work hard and have a good career if you work really really really hard you'll have a great career
6643, 0 ### it is because you are you know what you are
6645, 0 ### if you ever have that thought ricocheting in your brain it will hurt a lot
6646, 1 ### superman is not only sent to earth from the heavens or krypton but he's sent in a pod much like moses was on the nile
6647, 1 ### it always works well
6648, 1 ### the second is columbus finally gets funded to go to india but he gets lost
6649, 1 ### i got accused in a few that i was actually sent by the pope to preach the trinity and catholicism in the middle east so you you believe who you want
6651, 1 ### they're your eyes
6653, 1 ### i became timely
6654, 1 ### the bad news is they were all photocopies so we didn't make a dime in revenue
6655, 1 ### he actually called me a meddling kid the other day
6656, 1 ### i have work to do
6657, 1 ### you know
6658, 0 ### consider this like the prophets all the superheroes are missing parents
6659, 0 ### it doesn't matter what your religion is even if you're an atheist you don't raise your kid telling him you know make sure you lie three times a day
6660, 0 ### after a while his advisers complained
6661, 0 ### so these stones a few kind of rules in the game number one you don't choose the stone the stone chooses you
6662, 0 ### some believe that means that the original interpretation from a couple thousand years ago is what's relevant today
6663, 0 ### and the last point about the stones is this
6665, 0 ### they don't know ok and they're trying to get another member of the to join them
6666, 0 ### what's happening there's too much darkness
6667, 0 ### but i can't help
6669, 0 ### stay away from me
6672, 1 ### i got a little bit excited that day as you can see
6675, 0 ### and there's a name for people like global citizens
6678, 1 ### i wanted my own clothing line
6682, 0 ### and there were young people who were killing each other for reasons that i thought were very trivial like bumping into someone in a high school hallway and then after school shooting the person
6683, 0 ### and you can go to any emergency room at any hospital and you would see lying on young black and latino men shot and dying
6688, 0 ### at first the results were predictable
6690, 1 ### it's really good for hangovers
6691, 1 ### it changes the sound of your voice quite dramatically
6693, 0 ### but it's always there
6694, 0 ### and even though i'm a visual artist i'm interested in the invisibility of the air
6696, 1 ### ladies and gentlemen
6697, 0 ### and you all have chosen your own instruments to fulfill this mission of creating a better world
6699, 0 ### now when i say that what most people hear me say is that we're working on curing cancer
6700, 1 ### i wondered what that meant about much of the rest of new haven
6703, 0 ### i walked as though my legs were wooden
6704, 1 ### let's call him nick because that's his name
6705, 1 ### so it's great good job but not really that interesting definitely not
6706, 1 ### but i still have six and a half minutes
6707, 1 ### he said well we have the bing searches
6709, 0 ### they studied it very carefully skeptically they approved it
6710, 0 ### think things should go ok
6712, 0 ### and these reports are pretty simple it has all the diseases that the patient has all the drugs that they're on and all the adverse events or side effects that they experience
6713, 0 ### russ he said i've created a that can look at the side effects of a drug based on looking at this database and can tell you whether that drug is likely to change glucose or not
6714, 1 ### com which is barbie klaus
6715, 1 ### and if dinner isn't entirely obvious think of sex
6717, 0 ### it's just been industrial which means those who were producing had to have a way of raising money to pay those two and a half million dollars and later more for the telegraph and the radio transmitter and the television and eventually the mainframe
6718, 1 ### it's fun
6719, 1 ### it's very short and only in one direction
6720, 1 ### so i just check before it's finished
6721, 1 ### but most probably i did something like that
6723, 1 ### i have no checklist for that
6725, 1 ### but it was too stony and full of cactus on top
6727, 1 ### it's possible to start already now it's just too dangerous
6728, 0 ### yves uses his body to steer the wing
6730, 0 ### he is down
6731, 0 ### there is no turning back now
6732, 0 ### and now he's in edinburgh
6735, 0 ### and it's really like the kid playing the airplane
6736, 0 ### i don't do special physical training
6738, 1 ### he had a good laugh at the other teachers and put it up on the notice board
6740, 1 ### say my bad
6741, 1 ### i'm joking
6742, 1 ### something happened along the line
6743, 1 ### i remember the time when my mother used to dress me up as a little girl that's me there because she wanted a girl and she has only boys
6744, 1 ### but i'm very civil in my action i assure you
6745, 0 ### i don't play sports
6746, 0 ### i love her to bits
6748, 0 ### i must have done about caricatures
6749, 0 ### so i was flipping through the pages of the times of india when i saw that the prime minister of india was visiting my home town bangalore
6750, 0 ### and what happened was to my luck i saw a nuclear scientist at whose party i had done cartoons
6751, 0 ### that's when i realized you know cartoons are really powerful art comes with responsibility
6752, 1 ### she's trying to get that done
6753, 0 ### and he again had to travel to the school to get the information from the teacher stored it in the only portable memory he has which is inside his own head and take it with him because that is how information was being transported from teacher to student and then used in the world
6754, 1 ### and i'm very glad to say i don't think i have many friends who are competent and reliable but extremely dishonest
6755, 0 ### and the third is a task we should rebuild trust
6756, 1 ### well so we did this huge interview survey with lots of travel services and tried to figure out who changed and where did they go and it turned out that they don't know themselves
6757, 0 ### i mean you have the typical european cities with a dense urban core good public transportation mostly not a lot of road capacity
6759, 1 ### and when i would feel sorry for myself as nine or year old girls do she would say to me my dear on a scale of major world tragedies yours is not a three
6760, 1 ### first of all no one turns down a fulbright and secondly mcdonald's is always hiring
6761, 0 ### six years ago i started writing about women entrepreneurs during and after conflict
6762, 0 ### so if you're going to talk about jobs then you have to talk about entrepreneurs
6763, 0 ### think about this here were girls who braved danger to become breadwinners during years in which they couldn't even be on their streets
6764, 1 ### that's the positive part
6765, 1 ### they're just like you and me
6766, 1 ### this is the moon rising over earth and this is what we now call a which at that time by the way that word didn't exist
6767, 1 ### that didn't work either
6769, 0 ### along with that what we now know as planets comets and asteroids formed
6770, 0 ### the important thing here to note is that in the meantime the four and a half billion years these comets have been sitting on the outside of the solar system and haven't changed deep frozen versions of our solar system
6772, 0 ### rosetta made a few historic firsts
6773, 0 ### we recognized features boulders craters and that's how we know where we are respective to the comet
6774, 1 ### someone who didn't have a childhood is out there
6776, 1 ### but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill
6781, 0 ### and you can examine everything
6783, 0 ### the point is the white pill is not as good as the blue pill is not as good as the capsule is not as good as the needle
6784, 1 ### but we at harvard were wondering if this was really true
6786, 1 ### we're going to try science
6787, 1 ### so although that would be really really awesome again that's extremely extremely impractical
6789, 1 ### so the entire data set is a billion times more awesome than this slide
6790, 1 ### you might also want to have a look at this particular n gram and that's to tell nietzsche that god is not dead although you might agree that he might need a better publicist
6791, 1 ### people realized that was going to happen and it could be big
6792, 1 ### finally in someone woke up and realized that had gotten somewhat pass
6793, 1 ### one mistake you should not do is become a mathematician
6794, 1 ### but guess what nobody will really care
6795, 1 ### people have been using this for all kinds of fun purposes
6797, 0 ### so what that means is one could use computational methods to read all of the books in a click of a button
6798, 0 ### now if those books are not lost to history then they are somewhere in a library and many of those books have been getting retrieved from the libraries and digitized by which has scanned million books to date
6799, 0 ### that gives us a time series of how frequently this particular sentence was used over time
6800, 0 ### and so i might say yesterday i throve
6801, 0 ### we are losing interest in the past more rapidly
6802, 0 ### and of course what we're seeing is the fact marc chagall was a jewish artist in nazi germany
6803, 0 ### and we just divide one by the other to produce something we call a suppression index
6804, 0 ### people talked about it twice less as it should have been
6805, 0 ### except is a lens on biology through the window of the sequence of bases in the human genome
6806, 0 ### we have to make this available for people
6808, 1 ### the average taxi is going and a half miles per hour on our city streets and it turns out it stays that way for the entire day
6809, 1 ### these are the top grossing fire hydrants in terms of parking tickets
6810, 0 ### the will boast how many miles of subway track there are
6811, 0 ### so they go back to their raw data they count they add they calculate and then they put out reports and those reports will have numbers like this
6813, 1 ### my friend danny hillis says kind of a similar one he says technology is anything that doesn't work yet
6814, 1 ### when king henry of england died he had things in his house but that was the entire wealth of england so
6815, 1 ### that's actually my son right here
6816, 0 ### in the united states there is a state of the union address given by every president since
6817, 0 ### we would die by the billions and very quickly the wolves would get us we would be defenseless we would be unable to grow enough food or find enough food
6818, 0 ### and if you go there you say hey everybody's really healthy
6820, 1 ### this little chap here he stood there for five minutes motionless
6821, 0 ### and i needed a subject that felt extraordinary
6822, 1 ### understandably they weren't too happy with our line of questioning and let's just say we received our fair share of alternative facts
6823, 0 ### but she's in constant pain
6826, 1 ### i've got two questions for you
6828, 1 ### that's extremely unlikely
6829, 1 ### there you go it's tails
6831, 0 ### i'm pretty sure there are at least seven companies you've interacted with today
6833, 0 ### these whistle blowers risk their careers their friendships to bring out the truth about their companies
6837, 0 ### meet immanuel kant century german philosopher superstar
6839, 1 ### it's interesting
6840, 1 ### so before any one goes out of sync i'll just put those right there
6842, 0 ### in fact i'll try to explain today that sync is maybe one of if not one of the most perhaps the most pervasive drive in all of nature
6843, 0 ### so these are not particularly intelligent creatures and yet as we'll see they exhibit beautiful ballets
6844, 1 ### it's a pretty common one so when so few hands go up either you're not paying attention or you don't know your blood type and both of those are bad
6845, 0 ### and i didn't know that either until i took these courses in college but back then and this was in let's just call it the people didn't know much about why our cells are coated with sugar
6846, 1 ### my friends call me nicknames such as the giant clam girl clam queen or the mother of clams
6847, 1 ### i thought really so out of curiosity i did an experiment using myself as bait
6850, 0 ### to find out we placed numerous baby clams on a grid
6851, 0 ### but giant clams are endangered
6852, 1 ### i don't know if y'all noticed that
6853, 0 ### when it moves it moves like wildfire
6854, 1 ### and testing to simulate a person in a wetsuit in the water with a predatory shark in a natural environment is actually a lot harder than you might think
6856, 0 ### the incident of shark engagements on humans is escalating worldwide
6858, 1 ### let's start with theater
6859, 0 ### theater awakens our senses and opens the door to our imagination
6860, 1 ### so not only has the fly not got the nectar from the mimic plant it's also if you look very closely just at the head end you can see that it's got a bit of pollen that it would be transmitting to another plant if only some botanist hadn't come along and stuck it to a blue piece of card
6861, 1 ### this flower with its black dots they might look like black dots to us but if i tell you to a male insect of the right species that looks like two females who are really really hot to trot
6862, 1 ### so it's deceiving on two levels fabulous
6863, 1 ### and they get inside and they get it all on
6865, 0 ### now the way that plants transmit that information is through pollen
6866, 0 ### so all the grasses which means all of the cereal crops and most of the trees have wind borne pollen
6867, 0 ### plants have evolved to create little landing strips here and there for bees that might have lost their way
6868, 1 ### it's the money shot
6869, 0 ### and the satellite imagery we have of it today is old
6870, 1 ### what it showed me is that there's a grassroots movement going on of socially responsible designers who really believe that this world has got a lot smaller and that we have the opportunity not the responsibility but the opportunity to really get involved in making change
6872, 1 ### i'm not sure what they're smoking
6873, 1 ### if you're ever ever in india go use this toilet
6874, 1 ### and what we need is something that replicates me globally because i haven't slept in seven years
6875, 1 ### my mom once said there's nothing worse than being all mouth and no trousers
6876, 0 ### but when i went to architecture school it seemed that i was a black sheep in the family
6878, 0 ### but i live in bozeman montana go up to the north plains on the reservations or go down to alabama or mississippi pre katrina and i could have shown you places that have far worse conditions than many developing countries that i've been to
6879, 0 ### so we began to get involved in projects there and i'll talk about some others
6880, 0 ### all problems are local
6881, 0 ### we can talk about but that's another talk
6882, 1 ### there are no slides so you'll just have to be content with me
6883, 1 ### i want to tell you that
6886, 1 ### and nobody knows except a few smart people
6888, 0 ### this is the africa of opportunity
6889, 0 ### this arrest occurred because there was cooperation between the london metropolitan police and the economic and financial crimes commission of nigeria led by one of our most able and courageous people mr
6890, 0 ### and therefore when you hear about the corrupt africa corruption all the time i want you to know that the people and the governments are trying hard to fight this in some of the countries and that some successes are emerging
6892, 0 ### all the time when they talk about it you immediately think about africa
6893, 0 ### because if we can get the billion dollars sitting out there back it may be far more for some of these countries than all the aid that is being put together
6895, 1 ### which is ironic because i'm a capitalist
6896, 1 ### i would like for them to fire the boss that's me
6898, 1 ### however if you are a celebrity or an athlete and you're listening to this please feel free to bring your money
6899, 0 ### my white grandmother was born on her family's plantation in arkansas in
6901, 0 ### you may not have heard of worker ownership but it's been an incredible tool for black economic liberation for a century and it's also working all over the world right now
6903, 0 ### stands for the los angeles union cooperative initiative and our objective is to create more worker owned businesses here in los angeles
6904, 1 ### he figured out the system
6905, 0 ### and about three years ago i started an exercise in openness and inclusiveness by reaching out into the open source software community to create new digital tools for magic tools that could eventually be shared with other artists to start them off further on in the process and to get them to the poetry faster
6906, 1 ### it's very ingenious as all freudian arguments are but didn't make much sense because i have seen the same delusion a patient having the same delusion about his pet poodle
6907, 1 ### right now you try using the freudian explanation there
6909, 1 ### you don't even have to be jewish
6911, 1 ### so i hit on a way of doing this for three dollars but don't tell my funding agencies
6912, 1 ### so i said ok this proves my theory about learned paralysis and the critical role of visual input but i'm not going to get a nobel prize for getting somebody to move his phantom limb
6913, 1 ### i said what's gone i thought maybe the mirror box was gone
6915, 1 ### ok
6916, 1 ### well it's one or two mutants
6917, 1 ### sorry about that
6919, 0 ### so you can then map function onto structure and then find out what the doing to generate that particular function
6920, 0 ### and that's been called the face area in the brain because when it's damaged you can no longer recognize people's faces
6921, 0 ### she's some other woman pretending to be my mother
6922, 0 ### and then as you grow up the cortex develops and inhibits these latent sexual urges towards your mother
6926, 0 ### it's a lovely example of the sort of thing we do take a bizarre seemingly incomprehensible neural psychiatric syndrome and say that the standard freudian view is wrong that in fact you can come up with a precise explanation in terms of the known neural anatomy of the brain
6927, 0 ### ok the reason is there's a separate pathway going from the hearing centers in the brain to the emotional centers and that's not been cut by the accident
6928, 0 ### he knows that the arm is not there but nevertheless it's a compelling sensory experience for the patient
6929, 0 ### but when we were looking at the case sheets what we found was these people with the paralyzed phantom limbs the original arm was paralyzed because of the peripheral nerve injury
6931, 1 ### don't worry
6933, 1 ### we have to recognize they're different from us
6935, 0 ### this is a picture of culture
6937, 0 ### land is a kind of property it is property
6938, 1 ### in the words of samuel johnson remarriage is the triumph of hope over experience
6939, 1 ### and i just want to make it absolutely clear that he's a really bad example of the optimism bias because he is in fact uniquely talented
6940, 1 ### we can't all be better than everyone else
6941, 1 ### still think it's about percent
6942, 1 ### after that everything goes back to normal i assure you
6943, 0 ### in short we're more optimistic than realistic but we are oblivious to the fact
6944, 0 ### but private optimism about our own personal future remains persistent
6946, 0 ### some people say the secret to happiness is low expectations
6947, 0 ### and they found that when people with high expectations succeed they attribute that success to their own traits
6949, 1 ### mental note on that one
6953, 1 ### what we do as street skaters is you have these tricks say i'm working on or a primo that you guys know this stuff now
6957, 1 ### and another example of how the context changed and the creative process for me and for most skaters is you go you get out of the car you check for security you check for stuff
6959, 1 ### so next oh mind you
6960, 1 ### next these guys very similar community that's extremely conducive to innovation
6961, 0 ### freestyle itself we developed all these flat ground tricks as you saw but there was evolving a new kind of skateboarding where guys were taking it to the streets and they were using that ollie like i showed you
6965, 0 ### there's something called a primo slide
6966, 0 ### it's so much fun to do
6968, 0 ### what makes them great is the degree to which they use their skateboarding to themselves
6971, 0 ### in fact winning isn't the word i won it once
6972, 0 ### what it is is that there's an intrinsic value in creating something for the sake of creating it and better than that because i'm years old or i'll be and how pathetic is that i'm still skateboarding but there is there is this beauty in dropping it into a community of your own making and seeing it dispersed and seeing younger more talented just different talent take it to levels you can never imagine because that lives on
6975, 1 ### i feel like every time someone sneezes new orleans has a parade
6976, 1 ### before i die i want to be tried for piracy
6977, 0 ### and i thought about death a lot
6978, 0 ### before i die i want to be someone's cavalry
6982, 1 ### if you come back the next day and all the money is just gone you really need to dump that guy
6983, 1 ### this is not the type of consent like with an terms of service where you just scroll to the bottom and you're like agree agree whatever
6984, 1 ### and in a lot of states you're actually better off if you took the images of yourself because then you can file a copyright claim
6987, 0 ### and i totally get it there are serious legal risks and of course that potential for privacy violations
6988, 0 ### does this sound familiar it's exactly what we're worrying about now with social media and drone cameras and of course
6992, 1 ### you don't want to hear oops in real surgery
6993, 1 ### wish i could build my muscle this fast
6994, 0 ### so we call this table
6995, 0 ### i can cut any way i want to so i cut right here
6996, 1 ### with the same great feelings of suspense the same deep hopes for salvation the same sweat in the palms and the same people in the back not paying attention
7000, 1 ### you see in america even the second coming of christ has a section
7001, 1 ### it struck me that it would have been strange anyway for jesus to come back again and again based on the different time zones
7002, 1 ### i held on when i showed up at lehman brothers as an intern in
7005, 0 ### my eyes clenched tighter so i wouldn't see the wheat being separated from the chaff
7006, 0 ### they had been duped hoodwinked and i had gone right along with them
7008, 0 ### i realized that my story stood in for all those who were expected to pick themselves up by their bootstraps even if they didn't have any boots that my organization stood in for all the structural systemic help that never went to harlem or appalachia or the lower ward that my voice stood in for all those voices that seemed too too unwashed too
7009, 0 ### some of us may believe in the prophecy of bren brown or tony robbins
7010, 0 ### so i have not a gospel of disruption or innovation or a triple bottom line
7014, 1 ### you can watch me for one minute now and you'll see the whole thing
7016, 1 ### at this point i decided to make a pause
7017, 1 ### and that doesn't come easy from the mouth of a swedish public health professor
7020, 0 ### whether the man and woman decide to have small family and take care of their kids and how long they will live
7022, 0 ### there's mexico
7023, 0 ### and we will then see a completely different picture
7025, 0 ### i left them everywhere in cafes and in libraries at the u
7030, 1 ### they don't sit in seminars on saturday morning
7031, 1 ### and the reason he was was that len is a cold fish
7032, 0 ### that's what i'm going to be talking about
7034, 0 ### and then we were able to test them rigorously in random assignment placebo controlled designs throw out the things that didn't work keep the things that actively did
7035, 0 ### we forgot responsibility
7037, 0 ### so in the last years and the hope for the future we've seen the beginnings of a science of positive psychology a science of what makes life worth living
7038, 1 ### this one happens to be a particularly important galaxy because you are here
7039, 1 ### and life starts to expand and expand and expand until it goes
7040, 1 ### and that's the purpose of the universe and then it flat lines it doesn't get any better
7041, 1 ### a few more weeks without rain we would have never seen any of these
7043, 1 ### this explains most contemporary political debates
7045, 1 ### and this might have just one or two small ethical political moral implications
7046, 1 ### these conditions are highly rare
7047, 0 ### so you're now about billion years into this
7048, 0 ### we found another one last month
7049, 0 ### so about years ago by the black sea we had one mutation in one gene which led to blue eyes
7053, 0 ### so they go down one side of the mountain they go down another
7054, 0 ### and then what they did in october is they took skin cells turned them into stem cells and began to turn them into liver cells
7055, 0 ### you can tag them with proteins that light up when you light them
7056, 1 ### don't get me wrong i like fish and tomatoes but this is just creepy
7057, 1 ### and don't even get me started on the confined animal feeding operations called
7058, 0 ### little kids especially are attracted by colorful packaging and plastic toys
7060, 1 ### but the thing about self expression is that there's traditionally been this imbalance between the desire that we have to express ourselves and the number of sympathetic friends who are willing to stand around and listen
7061, 1 ### i feel a bit better now
7062, 1 ### we see i feel like i have been at a computer all day
7064, 1 ### for instance you could find women who feel addicted in their when it was cloudy in bangladesh
7065, 1 ### i feel these are actually an asset to college life
7066, 0 ### you know as i look around the world i see a lot of gaps and i think we all see a lot of gaps
7067, 0 ### and so what i do is i write computer programs that study very large sets of these footprints and then try to draw conclusions about the people who left them what they feel what they think what's different in the world today than usual these sorts of questions
7068, 0 ### it's reached about seven half million human feelings now
7070, 0 ### you can see a few of them are swarming around the cursor right now
7071, 0 ### and in that way you can connect with the authors of these statements if you feel some degree of empathy
7072, 1 ### if they liked an aria they would holler and suggest that it be done again as an encore not at the end of the show but immediately
7073, 1 ### that was bob's last record yeah
7074, 1 ### presumably this is just for christian music
7075, 0 ### music a clean break let's work by talking heads so the nature of the room meant that words could be understood
7076, 0 ### the music was in some ways different but in structure and form very much the same
7077, 0 ### we managed but sometimes those halls didn't seem exactly suited to the music i was making or had made
7078, 1 ### but he stopped next to my desk and he tapped on my desk and he said nice cat
7079, 1 ### when i was in the third grade i wrote a book for the first time the owl who thought he was the best flyer
7081, 1 ### i was clearly worried about my intellectual property when i was eight
7082, 1 ### my favorite page is the about the author page
7083, 1 ### there was an egg a tomato a head of lettuce and a pumpkin and they all lived in this refrigerator city and in one of their adventures they went to a haunted house that was filled with so many dangers like an evil blender who tried to chop them up an evil toaster who tried to kidnap the bread couple and an evil microwave who tried to melt their friend who was a stick of butter
7084, 1 ### now my publishing career began when i designed the cover for my eighth grade yearbook and if you're wondering about the style of dress i put our mascot in i was really into bell devoe and mc hammer and vanilla ice at the time
7087, 1 ### and we sat in silence for that brief moment and he said to me you're really talented
7088, 1 ### well two things rusty who was a great hamster and lived a great long life when i was in fourth grade
7089, 1 ### i convinced my grade english teacher to allow me to do my book report on stephen king's misery as an animated short
7090, 0 ### and when your parent is a drug addict it's kind of like charlie brown trying to kick the football because as much as you want to love on that person as much as you want to receive love from that person every time you open your heart you end up on your back
7091, 0 ### but they loved the hell out of me
7092, 0 ### i went to gates lane elementary school in worcester massachusetts and i had wonderful teachers there most notably in first grade mrs
7093, 0 ### i can't believe how much it costs to go to the prom
7094, 0 ### and i didn't understand
7095, 0 ### and on the day i met my father for the first time i was rejected from the rhode island school of design my one and only choice for college
7098, 0 ### but i know it's going to happen
7099, 0 ### my grandparents they were in the middle of it
7100, 0 ### i have picture books out
7101, 0 ### and i got to see my name in lights because kids put my name in lights
7102, 1 ### it's like this very fast very efficient way to get people off the street
7105, 0 ### but basically what i was talking about there we've now gotten to work
7106, 1 ### put a mouth on the top of the tree that's idiot
7107, 1 ### two women together they have an argument
7108, 0 ### since the age of five i started to learn how to draw every single stroke for each character in the correct sequence
7111, 1 ### he tells her i'd like to hand paint your portrait on a coffee mug
7112, 1 ### i'm a monkey blowing kisses at a butterfly
7113, 0 ### the start of the story where this means guy and that is a ponytail on a passer by
7115, 0 ### i got a pencil you can borrow
7116, 1 ### they know
7117, 1 ### school can be a problem in general but having also to explain to a teacher on a daily basis that their lesson is inexplicably dull and you are secretly taking refuge in a world inside your head in which you are not in that lesson that adds to your list of problems
7118, 1 ### wow you are really normal
7119, 0 ### he can't talk at all
7120, 0 ### that's one of the best things about being autistic
7121, 0 ### it can be that people don't want to be friends with the girl that starts screaming in an algebra lesson
7122, 1 ### imagine your last hamburger
7123, 0 ### environmentally meat amazingly causes more emissions than all of transportation combined cars trains planes buses boats all of it
7130, 0 ### excuses
7132, 0 ### the word is hail and it has a great definition as well
7134, 1 ### my classmate got an arsonist for her first client
7135, 1 ### we're talking about percent of the population or percent if you consider that no one's getting through adulthood without going through their first
7139, 0 ### work happened later marriage happened later kids happened later even death happened later
7141, 0 ### awesome twentysomethings really matter
7148, 1 ### i could have told them that
7149, 1 ### they pointed out that i believe it was between and years from today they will be steering cars by wire without all that mechanical stuff
7150, 1 ### and i can't believe a policeman is going to give themselves a ticket
7151, 1 ### i'm thinking wow that was great please lady don't say another word
7152, 0 ### it really was a big idea in technology when we started applying it in the for the disabled community
7153, 0 ### so the car the carriage that replaced the horse and carriage was a big deal it went twice as fast as a horse and carriage
7154, 0 ### and it is certainly a wonder
7155, 0 ### years ago locomotives got efficient enough steam power that we turned the continent into a country
7156, 1 ### so people are more afraid of insects than they are of dying
7157, 1 ### i think they're interesting and beautiful and sometimes even cute
7159, 1 ### i think sex in insects is more interesting than sex in people
7160, 1 ### on your rose bushes
7161, 1 ### and have penises that look kind of like swiss army knives with all of the attachments pulled out
7162, 0 ### insects seem like they do everything that people do
7163, 0 ### but what i think insects do is break a lot of the rules that we humans have about the sex roles
7164, 0 ### so it's not exactly a stereotypical set of rules
7166, 0 ### the way things are supposed to be
7167, 0 ### and i think that's why we've used males as models in a lot of medical research something that we know now to be a problem if we want the results to apply to both men and women
7168, 1 ### it's a tough market out there
7169, 1 ### that is i imagine what people in redmond wake up in the middle of the night thinking about
7170, 0 ### so we're in the forecasting business
7171, 0 ### but the difference of a few years on stock market valuations is obviously extreme
7172, 1 ### you would call the police
7173, 0 ### we just can't shake it off
7174, 1 ### every language communicates with pitch to varying degrees whether it's mandarin chinese where a shift in melodic inflection gives the same phonetic syllable an entirely different meaning to a language like english where a raised pitch at the end of a sentence
7176, 0 ### i'm going to start today with nature but before we do that let's quickly listen to this snippet of an opera singer warming up
7177, 0 ### let's listen to the full speed recording
7178, 1 ### why i mean if i'm a good i've got to believe there's a reason for that
7179, 1 ### he said what scientists do when a paradigm fails is guess what they carry on as if nothing had happened
7181, 1 ### and if you've got a scientific problem like that you can't solve it by holding a head count and saying more of us say yes than say no
7182, 1 ### it would be very nice for me if it happened soon
7183, 1 ### but you know that makes me feel good because richard dawkins has told us how to treat a priesthood
7184, 0 ### and they seem anxious to skirt around it and step over it and to talk about something else
7185, 0 ### the ancestor of the apes stayed in the trees our ancestors went out onto the plain
7186, 0 ### and they weren't savanna species
7187, 0 ### so we're left with a situation where we know that our earliest ancestors were moving around on four legs in the trees before the savanna ecosystem even came into existence
7188, 0 ### we've got to go back to square one and start again
7189, 0 ### you've been constructing fanciful things on top of it relying on it to be as solid as a rock
7190, 1 ### i don't think for instance that you will one day consult a supercomputer to learn whether you should have a second child or whether we should bomb iran's nuclear facilities or whether you can deduct the full cost of ted as a business expense
7192, 1 ### people will send you donations when you're in that condition
7194, 1 ### so we appear to have a genuine difference of opinion about how to profitably use one's time
7195, 1 ### the other half will tell you they don't like the question
7196, 1 ### i'm not a fan
7201, 0 ### even if you get your values from religion even if you think that good and evil ultimately relate to conditions after death either to an eternity of happiness with god or an eternity of suffering in hell you are still concerned about consciousness and its changes
7203, 0 ### but if we're going to talk about human well being we are of necessity talking about the human brain
7204, 0 ### and we can therefore visualize a space of possible changes in the experience of these beings
7205, 0 ### there is clearly a range of materials that constitute healthy food
7207, 0 ### now this brings us to the sorts of moves that people are apt to make in the moral sphere
7208, 1 ### but now let's look at the case for optimism
7209, 1 ### this disease is called sudden wealth syndrome
7210, 1 ### al gore made presentations in the house and the senate as an expert witness
7212, 0 ### tourists in glass bottomed boats would be viewing the drowned towers of miami through feet of tropical water
7213, 0 ### and if it will be it's the right thing to do and if not rethink it
7214, 1 ### we're talking national debt numbers here
7215, 1 ### places where year olds still ride their bike to work chop wood and can beat a guy years younger than them
7216, 1 ### but that's because all the young people left
7217, 1 ### instead these people drink a little bit every day not a hard sell to the american population
7218, 0 ### you have the food pyramid
7220, 0 ### but first i'd like to debunk some common myths when it comes to longevity
7221, 0 ### we are programmed for something called success
7222, 1 ### they came to me and said well what can we do to freshen this thing up and do you think kids you know surfers rock climbers would use these things and i said well not in that interior
7223, 0 ### what i discovered in these interiors is that there was a disconnect between the exterior shell and the interior architecture of the pieces
7224, 1 ### no dad you've only told me times and twice it wasn't my fault
7225, 1 ### statisticians we call that being within the percent confidence interval
7226, 1 ### we can average the two and see what that means
7227, 1 ### so now as a statistician what's my response show me the data dude you're talking chances i do chances all day long tell me all about chances
7229, 1 ### and then i said and i really don't think my due date is accurate
7230, 1 ### yeah that's a story you want to tell at your kid's wedding reception
7235, 1 ### and he said you can't breath out of your nose no but he can breath out of his mouth
7237, 0 ### you'll see that the temperature is not random
7239, 0 ### that's why you see those pregnant women just sweating and hot because their temperatures are high
7240, 0 ### so if there was a fertility issue or some problem i had data to show look we got pregnant our temperature shifted we somehow lost this baby
7241, 0 ### or if it gets too hot your thermostat registers turn the a
7245, 0 ### and so had we had some information about our heart health to share with him maybe we would have gotten a better diagnosis the first time
7246, 0 ### so over the course of that year and a half donald's eating changed and our exercise regimen changed and his heart rate responded his blood pressure responded to that change that he made in his body
7248, 1 ### oliver was an extremely dashing handsome charming and largely unstable male that i completely lost my heart to
7249, 1 ### but like with humans sometimes it's six months in before you realize that the person that you love has some issues
7250, 1 ### in other animals we have
7251, 1 ### so after they were taken away the sanctuary staff worried that he would fall into a depression and so to avoid that they gave him another rabbit friend
7252, 1 ### so then the choice becomes how do you well or do you poorly and poorly is all too common
7254, 0 ### and i spent the last seven years actually looking into this topic of mental illness in other animals
7255, 0 ### before the early century physicians often diagnosed emotional distress in their patients just by observation
7256, 0 ### so they won't go for a walk they won't hang out with their friends they won't eat
7257, 0 ### and if you just sort of happened upon this scene you might think that ting ting is just playing with a stick but ting ting does this all day and if you pay close attention and if i showed you guys the full half hour of this clip you'd see that he does the exact same thing in the exact same order and he spins the stick in the exact same way every time
7259, 0 ### canine veterans of conflicts of iraq and afghanistan are coming back with what's considered canine and they're having a hard time reentering civilian life when they come back from deployments
7260, 1 ### did we design this the principal of this kindergarten said no i don't want a handrail
7261, 1 ### and you get more and more more
7262, 1 ### the boy on the branch he loves the tree so he is eating the tree
7263, 1 ### monkeys in the zoo
7264, 1 ### but if you look at this the boy is not washing his boots he's putting water into his boots
7265, 0 ### they don't sleep in a quiet space
7266, 0 ### you know it's completely open
7267, 0 ### so you have to consider safety
7268, 0 ### and the circumference of this building is meters
7269, 0 ### thank you very much
7272, 1 ### you could dowse for all sorts of things but this particular one was built to dowse for marijuana in students' lockers
7273, 1 ### i'll show you
7274, 1 ### it'll go this way for sure
7281, 0 ### for intelligent design it's the end of the chain
7282, 0 ### so he wrote that he had seen i have observed that the furthest planet has three bodies
7284, 0 ### we went down and investigated
7285, 0 ### it's just a spring clean for the may queen
7289, 1 ### it's grown ups that get really upset
7291, 1 ### that was not a controlled descent
7292, 1 ### rb oh
7293, 1 ### yeah
7294, 1 ### now see if you can put it back together
7295, 1 ### and it's got a little bit of an emotional response here
7296, 1 ### you're such a cute little robot
7298, 1 ### no
7299, 1 ### no
7301, 1 ### i almost lost it this week
7303, 0 ### they are pretty common
7304, 0 ### but nevertheless those sorts of things are out there
7305, 0 ### at the bottom right is one that i built in my lab about years ago and we finally turned that into a product
7306, 0 ### battlefield companions are helping to reduce the combat risks
7307, 0 ### the worst thing that's happened in the cave so far was one of the robots fell down ten meters
7309, 0 ### and we've been trying to put that into our lab robots because we think this is how you're going to want to interact with robots in the future
7310, 0 ### and it weights those together into an attention window and it looks for the highest scoring place the stuff where the most interesting stuff is happening and that is what its eyes then segue to
7313, 0 ### here we asked them to get the robot's attention and indicate when they have the robot's attention
7314, 0 ### you don't see a description of how you know molecule a you know comes up and docks with this other molecule
7315, 0 ### years ago we had to give up the idea that we are the center of the universe when the earth started to go around the sun years ago with darwin we had to give up the idea we were different from animals
7318, 1 ### i spent hours piecing together the ones and zeros that formed a picture of a kitten
7322, 0 ### so let's consider an example of this that's completely theoretical
7324, 1 ### no they're not the same
7328, 1 ### what actually happens is if i compare this to the average real project average real successful project the family actually end up in south sulawesi at a cost of pounds whilst leaving two of the children behind
7329, 1 ### this was a group of eminent economists apologizing to the queen of england when she asked the question why did no one tell us that the crisis was coming i'll never get my knighthood
7332, 1 ### so if this is now and that's the past and we start thinking about change you know all governments are seeking change you're here seeking change everybody's after change it's really cool
7333, 1 ### is that okay it's a tap
7335, 0 ### so that's what i spend my time doing
7338, 0 ### we have the vision
7340, 0 ### there are charts which show all these movements of information
7341, 0 ### and then add to that every time you tweet over a third of your followers follow from a country which is not your own
7345, 0 ### and then something weird happens
7346, 1 ### christopher isherwood used the phrase the yellow leaf to describe a man at only one century after lord byron used it to describe himself at
7347, 0 ### there are patterns to life and they are shared
7350, 1 ### yeah
7351, 0 ### and the first rule of the game is pretty simple
7352, 1 ### we create them and then we send them either north or south
7353, 1 ### i had to become more reasonable because i thought people would listen to somebody who was rational but i remain radically rational whatever that is
7354, 1 ### i think i have my wife knows
7355, 0 ### well let me first begin by saying how deeply grateful i am for this opportunity to share my story with people who do care
7356, 0 ### and so on many occasions i've been asked by people you know you're suffering why don't you move back they don't understand
7357, 0 ### ok but these are the kinds of issues that people don't understand
7358, 1 ### now the american population can be broken up into three main categories there's mostly wonderful people haters and florida
7359, 1 ### i basically took all of the haters i put them in a petri dish like a scientist and this is what i found
7360, 0 ### it's a website that denounces terrorism every day of the week while taking the weekends off
7361, 0 ### sometimes i get mean and hate mail
7362, 1 ### hopefully it's faster
7364, 1 ### and the two other runners on the us team are not bad either
7365, 1 ### by the way i hope you appreciate the deep historical research i did to make the french look good
7368, 0 ### in the largest european economies productivity used to grow five percent per annum in the early
7369, 0 ### every generation is twice as well off as its parents'
7371, 0 ### those who carry the baton are slower but their baton is faster
7372, 0 ### compliance audits consultants' diagnostics
7374, 1 ### right now on a perfect day at the equator in the middle of summer on mars temperatures can actually reach degrees but then they go down to minus at night
7375, 1 ### some idiot will start a reality tv show
7377, 0 ### two million years ago humans evolved in africa and then slowly but surely spread out across the entire planet by reaching into the wilderness that was beyond their horizons
7378, 1 ### and we're not homophobic
7381, 1 ### when my husband and i saw a marriage counselor i thought she was a genius when she said i'll see you guys in two weeks but i need to see you next week sir
7382, 1 ### i'm nerdy
7383, 0 ### we collected jars of peanut butter and over valentine's day cards
7384, 0 ### it's my dad
7385, 0 ### and in four months we were in all area codes in america
7387, 0 ### and then it goes quiet minutes with no response from this girl
7388, 1 ### that's a fractional precision of
7389, 1 ### now the reason i have this beautiful asteroid fragment is because like all neighbors asteroids sometimes drop by unexpectedly
7390, 0 ### this was once part of a much larger object one of millions left over after the planets formed
7391, 0 ### i think of the search for these asteroids as a giant public works project but instead of building a highway we're charting outer space building an archive that will last for generations
7392, 1 ### instead apparently the egyptian government used a free demo version of software
7393, 1 ### government contractors who had at one point worked for the remote operating unit and were describing in surprising detail on their what they had done in their former job
7394, 0 ### it's for that reason that many activists specifically avoid using the telephone
7395, 0 ### his name is martin muench
7398, 1 ### mishawaka is many good things but cultural hub of the world it is not so my only exposure to theater and film was limited to the plays i did in high school and blockbuster video may she rest in peace
7400, 1 ### if things didn't work out i'd live in central park and dumpster dive behind bread
7402, 1 ### there's not a lot of places you can put those skills in the civilian world
7408, 1 ### and i'm watchin' and i'm waitin' like a eagle or like a no yeah like a eagle
7409, 1 ### and nobody nobody is gonna come between batman
7410, 1 ### they don't count on no dark knight with a stomach full of grocery store brand macaroni and cheese and cut up vienna sausages
7411, 0 ### firing weapons was cool driving and detonating expensive things was great
7412, 0 ### i knew i wanted to give acting another shot because again this is me i thought all civilian problems are small compared to the military
7414, 0 ### and for an organization like the military that prides itself on having acronyms for acronyms you can get lost in the sauce when it comes to explaining a collective experience
7415, 0 ### but it's also a service
7416, 0 ### jesse perez and matt johnson
7424, 0 ### and his cheeks is but not with sweat
7426, 1 ### they have electricity but the question is how many have washing machines i've done the scrutiny of market data and i've found that indeed the washing machine has penetrated below the air line and today there's an additional one billion people out there who live above the wash line
7427, 1 ### even the hardcore in the green movement use washing machines
7428, 0 ### and now she was going to watch electricity do that work
7430, 1 ### so it shows that we're really all in this together
7431, 0 ### they were responding to immediate concerns
7432, 1 ### this is the sound of a dirty sock
7433, 1 ### it's full of different melodies
7434, 1 ### it's just fabulous
7435, 1 ### now i dress in a way that it sounds good
7436, 0 ### so when i started to dream in color is when i felt that the software and my brain had united because in my dreams it was my brain creating electronic sounds
7437, 0 ### i was able to differentiate all the degrees of the color wheel
7438, 0 ### that's why two years ago i created the foundation which is a foundation that tries to help people become a tries to encourage people to extend their senses by using technology as part of the body
7439, 0 ### thank you
7441, 1 ### every morning there are people queuing outside their offices to reclaim these characters
7442, 0 ### it didn't come from there
7443, 0 ### thirty years later mountain bike sales and mountain bike equipment account for percent of bike sales in america
7444, 1 ### ok now if you did not allow me to deceive your minds you would all be able to do this
7445, 1 ### now you can see how easy it is for me to manipulate the human mind once you know how
7448, 1 ### i'm going to guide you into the car
7449, 1 ### nicole and actually here's the thing answer it answer it answer it
7450, 1 ### ok a little bit closer
7451, 1 ### a voodoo experiment
7453, 1 ### and only when you feel the pressure go back allow your hand to drift back to the tabletop but only when you feel the pressure
7454, 1 ### she's not taking any chances
7455, 1 ### think of that guy that that guy
7456, 1 ### and i want you to release that negative energy by shaking it from side to side
7458, 1 ### i was going to use you but i decided i might want to come back another year
7459, 1 ### there you are ok
7460, 1 ### ok and tell me when you're done
7461, 1 ### so all right we'll leave them like that
7463, 1 ### my hand is at risk here
7466, 1 ### no good decision
7470, 1 ### but if you were to guess
7471, 0 ### i want everybody downstairs also to join in with me and everybody
7472, 0 ### why is that ok swap them around put your right hand up
7473, 0 ### ok but don't say my name like that
7474, 0 ### i'm so afraid of what i'm going to see
7475, 0 ### god
7476, 0 ### there's a wall there's a wall
7477, 0 ### i'm looking at the road all the time
7481, 0 ### but because your brains are not trained in the art of deception the solutions you come up with will percent of the time be way off the mark
7483, 0 ### things that go bump in the night nicole no
7485, 0 ### twice
7486, 0 ### ok take a seat
7487, 0 ### that's it all the way down all the way down
7488, 0 ### ok
7491, 0 ### come right over here next to me
7492, 0 ### excellent
7495, 0 ### now you don't know where the spike is and i don't know where it is either
7496, 0 ### now i'm going to put on the blindfold
7497, 0 ### tell me when i'm over a cup
7501, 1 ### and he said this i came to realize
7502, 1 ### it is crap
7503, 1 ### there is no reason to learn how to show you're paying attention if you are in fact paying attention
7504, 1 ### if you want to state your opinion without any opportunity for response or argument or or growth write a
7505, 1 ### we're sitting there having a conversation with someone and then we remember that time that we met hugh jackman in a coffee shop
7506, 1 ### people who brag about their are losers
7507, 1 ### and calvin coolidge said no man ever listened his way out of a job
7508, 1 ### you're just two people shouting out barely related sentences in the same place
7509, 0 ### again that means we're not listening to each other
7510, 0 ### i talk to people that i don't like
7511, 0 ### we've had them before
7512, 0 ### and i don't mean just set down your cell phone or your tablet or your car keys or whatever is in your hand
7513, 0 ### you need to enter every conversation assuming that you have something to learn
7515, 0 ### were you angry yes i was very angry
7517, 0 ### number eight stay out of the weeds
7518, 0 ### she won a pulitzer prize
7519, 0 ### thanks
7521, 1 ### as grown in new york the fruit usually fails to develop properly in size and quality and is on the whole unsatisfactory
7524, 0 ### now i know that many of you don't stop to think about diversity in agricultural systems and let's face it that's logical
7527, 1 ### it's nearly impossible to get paint to stick to the grease in an egg
7529, 0 ### it was about shadows
7530, 1 ### they started suspecting that what we do on the morning and the afternoon it's on the news bbc
7531, 1 ### and he asked me do you know how to use this i said i have never seen it
7532, 0 ### but what i've been doing when i was about i grew in my uncle's house
7533, 0 ### so i did it
7534, 1 ### for me i really love this idea
7536, 1 ### so we set up a quick experiment here to show that to you
7537, 1 ### now our next technology is actually a pole and i have it right here in my pocket
7538, 1 ### in our we came up with the idea you could use it for a soccer goal so at the end of the game you just roll up the goal and put it in your gym bag
7539, 1 ### now the interesting thing about this is you don't have to be an engineer to appreciate why a pole that can fit in your pocket is so interesting
7540, 1 ### woman i would make a spear that when you went deep sea diving you could catch the fish really fast and then roll it back up and you could swim easier
7541, 1 ### you sir come on up
7542, 1 ### good luck to you
7544, 1 ### now zach we're going to demonstrate a water gun fight from the future
7545, 1 ### it's so safe you could drink this stuff
7546, 1 ### his company actually did a survey of firemen all across the country to try to learn how are they currently testing the air when they respond to an emergency scene and he kind of comically explained that time after time what the firemen would say is they would rush to the scene of the crime they would look around if there were no dead policemen it was ok to go
7547, 0 ### now go ahead and open it up
7548, 0 ### but to really think about the implications of what this makes possible we found that it helps to think about how it could be applied in the world
7549, 0 ### and we were showing him the same gel magnet that you're holding in your hand and you know we shared the same ideas
7551, 0 ### so now when we dream up these concepts it's important for us to make sure that they work from a technical standpoint
7553, 0 ### again it's perfectly safe for people
7554, 0 ### while he was doing this he noticed an unexpected thing
7555, 0 ### contrast that with a plastic garbage can and you can push in the sides and it always bounces back
7556, 0 ### now to think about the potential for this think of all the places ink is supplied on business cards on the back of cereal boxes board games
7557, 0 ### for our last technology we worked again with roman and his team at the directors bureau to develop a commercial from the future to explain how it works
7558, 0 ### don't let milk spoil your morning
7559, 0 ### so that was the six we had for you today but i hope you're starting to see why we find these things so fascinating
7561, 0 ### our cars are very quickly going to start driving themselves which means we're going to need fewer truck drivers
7562, 1 ### you may not recognize me because i used to part my hair differently there
7564, 1 ### it's because well thousands of years ago people invented ideas they had ideas innovations technology and the stone age ended not because we ran out of stones
7565, 0 ### it's great stuff
7566, 1 ### i'm not going to talk about the skeptical environmentalist probably that's also a good choice
7568, 1 ### we have you know the day after tomorrow it looks great right it's a good film in the sense that i certainly want to see it right but don't expect emmerich to cast brad pitt in his next movie digging latrines in tanzania or something
7569, 0 ### there are million people starving
7570, 0 ### in an ideal world we would solve them all but we don't
7573, 1 ### which is a lot until you realize that percent of them are the same ones you had the day before
7574, 1 ### my most popular don't eat that cookie
7575, 1 ### this is odd
7578, 1 ### and i always feel rather smug then
7584, 0 ### when my son my youngest was born there was not as far as i was aware a single out gay woman in british public life
7590, 0 ### isn't that great wonderful i'm thrilled
7592, 0 ### nothing
7594, 0 ### the fact is this is not enough
7596, 1 ### using this pointer made out of reflective markers i can point to where i want the quad to be in space a fixed distance away from me
7598, 1 ### similar to the diver and the it is only through repeated practice that the maneuver can be learned and executed to the highest standard
7600, 1 ### okay here goes
7601, 0 ### on board are also a battery a computer various sensors and wireless radios
7602, 0 ### the bulk of our research is algorithms
7603, 0 ### we first captured the dynamics with a set of differential equations
7605, 0 ### and that's why you don't need to model the glass
7606, 1 ### and so this guy gets the snail all set up and gives it a good whack
7607, 1 ### and believe it or not they went for it
7608, 1 ### and low light is a critical issue with filming animals because if it's too high you fry them
7609, 1 ### and yeah
7610, 1 ### i hope there aren't any snail rights activists around here
7613, 1 ### so i'd like to end on sort of a wacky note
7617, 0 ### the body flexes backwards just a spectacular movement
7618, 0 ### and mantis shrimp are officially the fastest measured feeding strike of any animal system
7619, 0 ### and what this basically consists of is a large muscle that takes a good long time to contract and a latch that prevents anything from moving
7620, 0 ### and those membranous areas suggested to me that maybe this is some kind of flexible structure
7622, 0 ### so it's very well known to engineers not as well known to biologists
7623, 0 ### and one of the reasons why he designed roofs this way is because it's he found it fascinating that you could build such a strong structure that's made of so few materials and can be supported by so few points
7625, 1 ### i found out later that they are uncomfortable but i admired it
7626, 0 ### and they kill lions
7633, 1 ### you know research
7634, 1 ### and so together with ken at the media lab we created this new high resolution version that uses an array of to change from interactive to a touch input device to a phone
7635, 0 ### but as tools have become more and more complex we need more complex controls to control them
7636, 0 ### and so that's what i've been doing at the mit media lab and now at stanford
7638, 1 ### and i don't know about you but living inside of windows scares me
7639, 1 ### you could put your holographic tesla that you're shopping for or whatever model my legal team told me to put in right before the show
7640, 0 ### and he pulls it towards himself and he looks down and he starts typing
7641, 0 ### and the more i thought of it the more i realized it was clearly not the digital information that was the bad guy here it was simply the display position that was separating me from my friend and that was binding those kids together
7642, 1 ### i actually think that being a girl is so powerful that we've had to train everyone not to be that
7643, 1 ### and they were all alone and i thought this is the secret life of men
7645, 1 ### i know that one kiss could take away all my decision making ability
7646, 0 ### and i want to call it the girl cell
7647, 0 ### and then let's think how compassion informs wisdom and that vulnerability is our greatest strength and that emotions have inherent logic which lead to radical appropriate saving action
7649, 0 ### in the congo for those of you who don't know there has been a war raging for the last years a war that has killed nearly six million people
7651, 1 ### i think it's been a weird years
7652, 1 ### and he just sobered up immediately and he stuck out his hand put a hand on my shoulder and in a real earnest very nice voice he was like i hope you make it someday
7654, 0 ### it doesn't matter if you're a newspaper or an institution or an independent creator
7655, 0 ### art used to be completely ephemeral so if you missed the symphony you just didn't get to hear the orchestra
7656, 1 ### it was not a compliment
7657, 1 ### i could tell from his tone the same tone that you would use to say something like you're a supporter of terrorism
7658, 1 ### he told me that people were saying that my novel was feminist and his advice to me and he was shaking his head sadly as he spoke was that i should never call myself a feminist because feminists are women who are unhappy because they cannot find husbands
7659, 1 ### at some point i was a happy african feminist who does not hate men and who likes lip gloss and who wears high heels for herself but not for men
7661, 1 ### she had forgotten to make that clear earlier because she assumed it was
7663, 1 ### at least not yet
7664, 1 ### of course there are many exceptions
7666, 0 ### now take my dear friend louis for example
7667, 0 ### i thought about naming the hotel but i thought i probably shouldn't
7668, 0 ### gender matters everywhere in the world but i want to focus on nigeria and on africa in general because it is where i know and because it is where my heart is
7669, 0 ### we teach boys to be afraid of weakness of vulnerability
7670, 0 ### we teach girls shame
7671, 0 ### had i then the confidence that i have now to be myself my students would have benefited even more from my teaching because i would have been more comfortable and more fully and more truly myself
7675, 0 ### i am a feminist
7676, 1 ### she could come to work in her pajamas and nobody would care
7677, 1 ### we will open the museum in a few days and i welcome all of you to get on qatar airways and come and join us
7678, 0 ### it's important for us to grow organically
7679, 0 ### life necessitates a universal world however we believe in the security of having a local identity
7680, 1 ### i'm here today to talk about autonomous flying beach balls
7681, 0 ### they're not even autonomous
7682, 1 ### so i decided that the best thing to do would be to convert my garage into a laboratory
7683, 0 ### however i soon realized that not everyone is fortunate enough to enjoy the clean water we did
7684, 1 ### there was a period of time when my wife her name is tammie and i we just got real busy and whip bam boom kendall and jay
7685, 1 ### there ain't no first time
7687, 0 ### just go on go on in your room
7688, 1 ### this was the first time a prime minister of india was given a parking ticket
7689, 0 ### they belonged to boys
7690, 1 ### as a multi purpose passenger vehicle it is now officially designed for occasional off road use
7692, 0 ### so instead of trying to make a car that can fly we decided to try to make a plane that could drive
7694, 1 ### it was my mom
7699, 1 ### now the reveal moment the subject is this person
7701, 0 ### this is the miracle of life
7702, 0 ### but it took us more than years to finally poke inside a human cell take out this crystal it and read it for the first time
7705, 0 ### for the rest we are all absolutely identical
7706, 1 ### it's no wonder you know we have criminals
7707, 0 ### these are some of my kids with a salad bar
7710, 1 ### harvard was wrong big time
7711, 1 ### and so what you've seen today is less than a fraction of one percent of what is in here and in the ted lab we have a tour that was created by a six named benjamin that will knock your socks off
7712, 0 ### but until now our view of the universe has been disconnected and fragmented and i think that many of the marvelous stories that nature has to tell us have fallen through the cracks
7713, 0 ### and in telling stories each of us is going to understand the universe in our own way
7714, 1 ### it's still early but i think we've picked up on the scent of something we're following
7715, 0 ### a trillion
7717, 0 ### here's what he wrote in starting that out
7718, 1 ### we haven't demonstrated this in humans yet but maybe it's just a matter of time before we find out
7719, 1 ### so this came out in a scientific journal a few years ago but more importantly it was featured on miami so you really know it's true
7720, 1 ### on the other hand when we do tours of our lab at the institute and we explain that we use robots and lasers to look at poop it turns out that not everyone wants to know
7721, 1 ### what we need to do though is we need to develop a kind of microbial where we don't just know where we are currently but also where we want to go and what we need to do in order to get there and we need to be able to make this simple enough that even a child can use it
7722, 0 ### and imagine if through new scientific advances we were just beginning to understand its importance to how we think of ourselves
7724, 0 ### each point here represents all the complex microbes in an entire microbial community
7725, 0 ### and we've just over the last few years found out that the microbes in different parts of the body are amazingly different from one another
7727, 1 ### what's this about well my graph has numbers on it
7728, 1 ### but we don't every minute together that's for sure
7734, 0 ### yeah in we read an article about diseases killing so many kids around the world and we kept saying to ourselves well that can't be
7735, 0 ### and so we picked those two things and everything the foundation does is focused there
7737, 0 ### melinda you're roman catholic and you've often been embroiled in controversy over this issue and on the abortion question on both sides really
7738, 1 ### it is not
7740, 1 ### although some days she's also a which is a choice that i can respect
7741, 1 ### they probably should have marketed this as some of the guardians of the galaxy
7744, 0 ### but when i talk about my daughter the word i find myself saying most is athlete
7749, 0 ### they control the conversation
7751, 1 ### uh oh
7753, 1 ### the us election matters a lot on that one too
7754, 1 ### look i do think we have to recognize my fellow campers that when you are being chased by the bear in the global context you need not outrun the bear you need to only outrun your fellow campers
7756, 0 ### that's what wanted to talk about
7757, 0 ### the doesn't work the all of our friends that's history
7759, 0 ### we produce all that right here in the united states
7760, 1 ### this is a woman in an electric wheelchair chasing a duck in circles on the road
7762, 1 ### thank you
7763, 0 ### now today i'm going to talk to you a little bit about the difference between patching around the problem with driver assistance systems and actually having fully self driving cars and what they can do for the world
7765, 0 ### so if you take the average commute time in america which is about minutes you multiply that by the million workers we have that turns out to be about six billion minutes wasted in commuting every day
7766, 1 ### i mean just take a look at some of the titles of self help books awaken the giant within practicing the power of now or here's a great one we can all relate to you are a how to stop doubting your greatness and start living an awesome life
7767, 1 ### if you're like most people when you hear the words our organization is going to start a transformation you're thinking uh oh
7768, 1 ### you know frankly i'm not that good but i do have one distinct capability i am remarkably fast at finding my bike
7770, 0 ### in fact i call this the era of always on transformation
7772, 0 ### or given the urgency what they'll do is they'll just focus on the short term results but that doesn't give any hope for the future
7776, 1 ### our lives were one part cuckoo's nest one part and one part a beautiful mind
7779, 1 ### these people don't mind that i once worked as a singing waitress to help pay for college
7782, 0 ### the conventional thinking has been that trauma leads to distress and there's been a lot of focus on the resulting dysfunction
7783, 0 ### this guy's parents give him up for adoption
7786, 1 ### you would never know until she told you
7788, 0 ### now these animals are different from one another because they have different genes
7791, 1 ### i'm not talking about a revolution where you have to worry about the governor of california showing up at your door a la the terminator
7794, 0 ### that soldier had been on top of the bomb
7797, 1 ### ah uh aristotle said that nature abhors one
7815, 0 ### he said ok we're going to start having these meetings
7816, 0 ### and so they would come in and you would do anybody that was going to show an experiment which was kind of a new word at the time demonstrate some principle they had to do it on stage where everybody could see it
7820, 1 ### and i called him up and said listen i ran one race and i won
7821, 1 ### and i i mean was just mortified because i was signed up for the you know which went off in a half hour
7825, 1 ### well these are my pretty legs
7827, 1 ### just take them off
7828, 1 ### it's like a barbie foot under this
7829, 1 ### they got someone to come in and saw off the shoes
7832, 0 ### in fact i'd never even met another amputee until i was
7835, 0 ### you can run on our women's track team here
7836, 0 ### so i don't know it started to become an interesting mix
7841, 1 ### i was a very very serious child
7843, 0 ### and this reflects the extraordinary strength of the emerging indian middle class and the power that their mobile phones bring
7844, 1 ### the first two letters of the word that's all that made it through an l and an o and then a buffer overflow crashed the system
7847, 0 ### because it's not failure itself that constrains us
7848, 1 ### i'd flunked out of college not once but twice and maybe even a third time that i'm not going to tell you about
7849, 1 ### so i'm on the right stage
7852, 0 ### or a person who fits in badly
7853, 0 ### the short story was about my life as a competitive swimmer and about my home life and a little bit about how grief and loss can make you insane
7856, 1 ### this is mountains out of a timeline of global media panic
7857, 1 ### these little green peaks are asteroid collisions
7860, 1 ### so in order to really create a full image i had to honor the perspectives on the right hand side and at the same time uncomfortably recognize how many of those qualities were actually in me which was very very annoying and uncomfortable
7861, 1 ### so essentially we had our first carbon neutral volcano
7862, 0 ### this is the billion dollar o gram and this image arose out of frustration i had with the reporting of billion dollar amounts in the press
7863, 0 ### you can literally see them
7864, 0 ### and it mushroomed slightly
7866, 0 ### as you can see there's a kind of odd regular pattern in the data twin peaks every year
7868, 1 ### the masses move again not according to newton's laws but because they see this space time curvature and follow the little curves just like when our nestles up to us because of the mattress curvature
7870, 0 ### we want to measure longitudes distances
7874, 1 ### they can swell enormously when you add water to them an experiment done by millions of kids every day
7876, 1 ### so it's probably better to fall into tibet because you'll live longer
7879, 0 ### there's only one third as much oxygen at the summit as there is at sea level
7880, 1 ### not much has changed by the way
7882, 0 ### now in the course of time we've come to realize that different parts of the brain do different things
7888, 1 ### a little bit of seafood and some and the picture actually tastes exactly like the dish
7890, 1 ### so when you're looking at this thing in the dining room you have this sensation that this is actually a plate of nachos and it's not really until you begin tasting it that you realize this is a dessert and it's just kind of like a mind ripper
7891, 1 ### can we take what the cow eats remove the cow and then make some hamburgers out of that and basically the reaction tends to be kind of like this
7892, 1 ### let's charge them a boatload of cash for this and see what they think
7893, 0 ### and after about the ten thousandth request for a maki roll we decided to give the people what they wanted
7894, 0 ### what i see is a cow about to eat something delicious
7895, 0 ### so replicating food taking it into that next level is where we're going
7896, 0 ### let's just stop and think about the economic benefits of something like that
7898, 1 ### i have spent too much time in california and i strongly feel that weather should be optional
7899, 1 ### i see everybody from the pacific northwest is like i have some suggestions for you
7901, 1 ### now nothing sees more clouds than a satellite not even a british person
7902, 1 ### on earth we have whiskey
7903, 0 ### i mean even i could put up with a few more cloudy days if clouds saved the planet
7904, 0 ### we know it's going to get hot but we don't know exactly how hot it's going to get
7906, 0 ### for example different climate models are largely able to capture the warming that we've seen so far
7907, 0 ### and that is because just like me computers hate clouds
7909, 1 ### i can make a really great box
7911, 0 ### or we decide that we're going to prevent dementia and it will never happen to us because we're going to do everything right and it won't come and get us
7912, 1 ### both are fairly bad for your health
7914, 1 ### very good
7915, 1 ### on one occasion i was doing it every time i did a point that they didn't like they actually threw stones at me and when i did a point they liked they starting shooting in the air equally not great
7916, 0 ### so if you have a traditional perception of terrorism it would be that it's one of criminality one of war
7917, 0 ### it's a load of nonsense
7918, 0 ### there's two essential ways of doing that if we carry on this brand theme
7919, 0 ### you could be looking there at poverty injustice all those sorts of things which feed terrorism
7920, 1 ### once i was physically occupying the space that would ultimately give way to my childhood aspirations i anticipated a smooth glide to the
7921, 0 ### beyond the physical landscape of our planet some of the most famous celestial images are of intersections
7923, 1 ### suddenly we're almost longing for him to return
7927, 0 ### so the answer is yes
7928, 0 ### you all know what the likelihood is of pulling the ace of spades or of flipping a heads
7930, 1 ### now before we get started this is great
7932, 0 ### in order to teach you this game i'm going to need some volunteers to come up onstage really quickly and we're going to do a little hands on demo
7933, 0 ### there are a billion gamers on the planet now so we need more of a challenge
7934, 1 ### now california's considering similar legislation and this would make sure that the autonomous car is not one of those things that has to stay in vegas
7935, 1 ### it's another one of those categories where maybe there's not a lot of competition
7937, 0 ### now if you're like me and the other percent of the population who know that we are above average drivers you understand that's a very high bar
7938, 0 ### and we discovered their human counterparts are amazing
7939, 0 ### you put them in a new car and after a few laps they've found the fastest line in that car and they're off to the races
7940, 1 ### i can love my wife
7941, 1 ### whereas my wife she calls me the star of her life
7943, 1 ### nothing could be less materialistic or more sentimental than a teenager buying brand new jeans and tearing them at the knees because he wants to please jennifer
7944, 0 ### think about the young woman who must remain chaste before marriage
7945, 0 ### and finally a process of rationalization of economic production and of trade liberalization
7946, 0 ### we can also imagine a chemical treatment for breakups that weakens the feelings of attachment
7949, 1 ### the trick here is my brother would become an experimental poet not a businessman but the intention was really good
7951, 1 ### growing up is about aiming to succeed wildly and being fulfilled by failing really well
7952, 1 ### one of them was i used to lie on the kitchen floor of my childhood home and i would suck the thumb of my left hand and hold my mom's cold toes with my right hand
7953, 0 ### feminism was the water i grew up in
7956, 0 ### but for me so is immigration
7957, 0 ### but we also have a straightforward political impact
7959, 1 ### and it turns out they are medical students on their way to a lecture about the latest techniques and he's the guy giving the lecture
7960, 1 ### they kind of have this vault where they're stored in high and george lucas did all the sound effects
7961, 0 ### and one night i'm riding the uptown local train
7963, 0 ### thank you
7964, 1 ### he looked me in the face and he said take off your shoe and give me your machete
7965, 1 ### this guy decided he would go down to the amazon and give it a whirl or give it a lick and he did and he wrote my blood pressure went through the roof i lost full control of my bodily functions i passed out in a heap i woke up in a hammock six hours later felt like god for two days
7966, 1 ### and if it looks like this picture is out of focus because it was taken in a hurry here's why
7967, 0 ### now four years ago i injured my foot in a climbing accident and i went to the doctor
7969, 0 ### they're painful they're expensive and they're probably not good for your heart it's a heavy metal
7970, 1 ### so i'm smiling
7971, 0 ### the materials that allowed the battery operated facial expressions is a material that we call and it actually has three major innovations in the material that allow this to happen
7974, 1 ### and as you know everybody loves that too
7975, 1 ### i also became really really good at failing
7977, 0 ### the second is observing people in real life situations and with them
7978, 0 ### design thinking is such a successful and versatile tool that it has been applied in almost every industry
7979, 0 ### now i also believe that people with disabilities have great potential to be designers within this design thinking process
7981, 0 ### if you compare how did against how john kerry had done four years earlier democrats really like seeing this transition here where almost every state becomes bluer becomes more democratic even states lost like out west those states became more blue
7983, 1 ### let me try to take this one step further
7984, 1 ### now i would attempt to square a five digit number and i can but unfortunately most calculators cannot
7986, 1 ### what i'd like each of you to do is to call out for me any six of your seven digits any six of them in any order you'd like
7987, 1 ### ok any six of them
7989, 1 ### it goes as far back into the past as because you never know
7990, 1 ### i didn't mean to look at you sir you were just sitting there
7991, 1 ### ab and it was cloudy
7992, 1 ### i know as a magician we're not supposed to reveal our secrets but i'm not too afraid that people are going to start doing my show next week so i think we're ok
7993, 1 ### now let me recap
7997, 1 ### i don't want you to think you're seeing something out of rain man
7998, 1 ### sorry
8003, 0 ### there is something called the square of a number which most of you know is taking a number and multiplying it by itself
8009, 0 ### oh yours does i can probably do it
8011, 0 ### you have a seven digit number call out any six of them please
8017, 0 ### five
8018, 1 ### if you shoot a particle at them and knock a hole in them they repair themselves they go zip and they repair the hole in which is not is really quick
8019, 0 ### but i also in looking at more powerful technologies and and genetic engineering and other new emerging kind of digital technologies became very concerned about the potential for abuse
8020, 1 ### tyler dewar the way i feel right now is that all of the other speakers have said exactly what i wanted to say
8021, 1 ### i thought that things would be pretty fun and there would be more things to play with
8022, 0 ### so it turned out that my fantasy about an entertaining life of being the wasn't going to come true
8023, 0 ### i talk to my mother once in a blue moon on the telephone
8024, 1 ### my favorite is the middle one the player nose hair trimmer and torch
8025, 1 ### work we are blessed as carl was pointing out with the technology that enables us to work every minute of every day from any place on the planet except the randolph hotel
8028, 1 ### here's another example
8029, 1 ### and after i recovered i said i want the kind that used to be the only kind
8032, 1 ### the secret to happiness this is what you all came for the secret to happiness is low expectations
8034, 0 ### the reason for this is both that freedom is in and of itself good valuable worthwhile essential to being human
8035, 0 ### this is my supermarket
8036, 0 ### you've got to admit that's a lot of choice
8037, 0 ### so in other aspects of life that are much more significant than buying things the same explosion of choice is true
8040, 0 ### the only real choice was who not when and not what you did after
8044, 1 ### the title is observations of in utero masturbation
8045, 1 ### i think the most curious one that i came across was a case report of a woman who had an orgasm every time she brushed her teeth
8046, 1 ### and the amazing thing to me is that you would think this woman would have excellent oral hygiene
8047, 1 ### it's so sad
8048, 0 ### now this is the part of the nervous system that deals with the things that we don't consciously control like digestion heart rate and sexual arousal
8049, 0 ### they brought women into the lab i think it was five women and outfitted them with cervical caps containing artificial semen
8050, 0 ### the sow doesn't look to be in the throes of ecstasy
8051, 0 ### this is basically a penis camera on a motor
8052, 1 ### so i just said well if that's the case then i'd like to leave
8053, 0 ### no one in my family ever had joined the military at all and how i first got introduced to the military was when i was years old and i got sent away to military school because my mother had been threatening me with this idea of military school ever since i was eight years old
8057, 1 ### don't bathe
8062, 1 ### this was reinforced by the political climate of the time
8063, 0 ### being a coward was not an insult
8065, 1 ### and they wouldn't let the other half out to go look for the first half because they were afraid they wouldn't come back
8066, 1 ### it's very difficult to figure out what that ad is for
8067, 1 ### by the way this is the beginning of the asbestos lawsuit
8069, 1 ### now not all these things were highly successful
8070, 1 ### this came in like six different colors
8072, 1 ### and you'd run a long cord into the house where you could screw it into your light socket
8073, 1 ### and they couldn't yank the cord out because it was screwed into a light socket inside the house
8075, 1 ### so we really haven't progressed that much since
8076, 1 ### and you know we think it's getting better but have you tried to install
8077, 1 ### s in computer science this process has brought them to tears absolute tears
8078, 1 ### my mom hates this picture
8079, 0 ### and so i think the tempting analogy for the boom bust that we just went through with the internet is a gold rush
8080, 0 ### it's a big deal
8082, 0 ### many have more
8083, 0 ### people on the east coast in when they first started to get the news they thought ah this isn't real
8085, 0 ### they loaded up their mules and their horses
8086, 0 ### the inhumanity which this trail has been witness to the heartbreak and suffering which so many have undergone cannot be imagined
8088, 0 ### and that was of course the very common story
8089, 0 ### it's not a specific thing
8090, 0 ### so the light bulb is what wired the world
8091, 0 ### this is work going on down in lower manhattan where they built some of the first electric power generating stations
8093, 0 ### they wired them for lighting
8094, 1 ### and i will do during those days whatever it is i was going to do if i had received that piece of news
8095, 1 ### make sure we are the bride you thought we were and not all the bullshit we put into our own ads
8096, 1 ### department and thankfully one of them has retired
8098, 1 ### so our board had two seats open with the same voting rights for the first two people who showed up
8099, 1 ### keep that to yourself
8100, 1 ### when you think and you say now is the time to give back well if you're giving back you took too much
8103, 1 ### one it freed our five kids from following in our steps our shadow they don't know what i do
8104, 1 ### and i'm not going to take them somewhere and say one day all of this will be yours
8105, 1 ### it's what i'd like to call my empty bucket list
8106, 1 ### so ricardo you're kind of crazy
8107, 1 ### so this is the problem
8108, 0 ### and you start thinking about what you would do with this time
8109, 0 ### the opposite of work is idleness
8110, 0 ### we looked at it and we said let's devolve to these people let's give these people a company where we take away all the boarding school aspects of this is when you arrive this is how you dress this is how you go to meetings this is what you say this is what you don't say and let's see what's left
8111, 0 ### and the average age of the first people who adhered were of course
8118, 0 ### so we need a thread in school that talks about everything we don't know
8120, 0 ### and they have a zero to percent grading which they do themselves with an app every couple of hours
8123, 1 ### so i whisper shouted back to him yes the computer can tell if you're lying
8124, 1 ### so i picked computers
8126, 1 ### it was clearly what i don't know isn't my problem go away death stare
8128, 1 ### it'd be lousy not to get a job one is qualified for but it would triple suck if it was because of stack overflow in some
8131, 0 ### to make things more complicated our software is getting more powerful but it's also getting less transparent and more complex
8132, 0 ### much of this progress comes from a method called machine learning
8133, 0 ### the head of ai systems called it the unreasonable effectiveness of data
8135, 0 ### and look human hiring is biased
8136, 1 ### and the following year they sent me this one which i thought was kind of funny
8137, 1 ### the says i give smokers a discount because not as much to tell
8140, 1 ### while your cholesterol level has remained the same the research findings have changed
8141, 1 ### and so you might start to lose weight and start to attract people towards you but when they get too close its going to be a problem
8142, 0 ### and so its not something happiness is not something you get health is generally not something that you get
8143, 0 ### so within that larger context we can talk about diet stress management which are really these spiritual practices moderate exercise smoking cessation support groups and community which ill talk more about and some vitamins and supplements
8144, 0 ### and what we found was that instead of getting worse and worse in many cases it could get better and better and much more quickly than people had once realized
8145, 0 ### clinically he literally walk across the street without getting severe chest pain within a month like most people was pain free and within a year climbing more than floors a day on a
8146, 0 ### as one woman said got friends in this package of cigarettes and always there for me and nobody else is
8150, 0 ### the fact is is that the british museum had a complete specimen of a dodo in their collection up until the century it was actually mummified skin and all but in a fit of space saving zeal they actually cut off the head and they cut off the feet and they burned the rest in a bonfire
8152, 1 ### yeah
8153, 1 ### einstein did you hear whispers squawks yeah

8165, 0 ### good job well before we wrap it up she would like to give a shout out to all our animal friends back at the knoxville zoo
8167, 0 ### thank you all
8170, 1 ### and then i told as many many people as i possibly could about it so that there was no way that i could chicken out later on
8171, 1 ### so i became my own intern
8172, 1 ### these are some pictures visitors sent to me
8173, 1 ### and they swept it all up and put it into custody at police headquarters
8174, 1 ### so after eight hours that's pretty much all that was left of the whole thing
8175, 1 ### then you can of course always go and see this guy
8176, 0 ### i originally had opened the studio in new york to combine my two loves music and design
8177, 0 ### so i decided to close it down for one year
8178, 0 ### and they rang very true for me
8180, 0 ### sri lanka still had the civil war going on so bali it was
8181, 0 ### then this is a fairly talkative kind of chair
8182, 0 ### and i'll show you a couple of people that did well by pursuing
8186, 1 ### i surprised myself as you may see in that photo
8189, 0 ### it proved harder for me to both get access and airtime in media
8190, 1 ### but like all of us he had some problems
8191, 1 ### and i know a little bit about these issues because for many years i spent a long time in the non profit industrial complex and i'm a recovering executive director two years clean
8192, 0 ### i find it interesting that for every one dollar we spend however on early childhood education like head start we save dollars on stuff like incarceration in the future
8193, 0 ### less than four percent of the folks that went through her program actually go back to jail
8194, 1 ### and there's others that are all about the toaster and the engineers love to draw the mechanics of this
8195, 0 ### the toast is then deposited for some time
8196, 1 ### i know what you're going to say no one uses tape recorders nowadays
8199, 1 ### and i thought i love this country
8201, 1 ### the first one is that you should never never ever give your cell number to donald trump
8204, 0 ### so i studied in the morning and worked in the afternoon
8205, 0 ### and we're not like that
8206, 0 ### ninety seven percent of all undocumented people in the united states are good people
8208, 1 ### and i actually feel at home here because there's a lot of autism genetics here
8209, 1 ### i've got that stuff up on if you want to look at it
8210, 1 ### and there were a lot of kind of types and autism types working out there on the movie set too
8213, 1 ### you know you once wrote i like this quote if by some magic autism had been eradicated from the face of the earth then men would still be socializing in front of a wood fire at the entrance to a cave
8214, 1 ### that was like we considered that super cool
8215, 0 ### i want to talk to you now about different ways of thinking
8216, 0 ### well if you're building a bridge details are pretty important because it'll fall down if you ignore the details
8217, 0 ### rapid movement contrast
8218, 0 ### my drawings got to star in the movie too
8220, 0 ### ok there's my childhood church that's specific
8221, 0 ### now i want to emphasize that not every autistic kid is going to be a visual thinker
8222, 1 ### they have what i called dementia which is they talk so much they drive themselves insane
8223, 1 ### another case last election cycle i was following mitt romney around new hampshire and he was campaigning with his five perfect sons chip rip zip lip and dip
8224, 1 ### and you can usually tell the uber moms because they actually weigh less than their own children
8225, 1 ### it would be a big seller
8226, 1 ### and they've become elegant and slender they don't really have thighs they just have one elegant on top of another
8227, 1 ### they're cross country skiing up the mountain with these grim expressions that make dick cheney look like jerry lewis
8228, 1 ### one of my favorite is that people named dennis are disproportionately likely to become dentists people named lawrence become lawyers because unconsciously we gravitate toward things that sound familiar which is why i named my daughter president of the united states brooks
8229, 1 ### time magazine asked americans are you in the top one percent of earners nineteen percent of americans are in the top one percent of earners
8230, 0 ### so in the course of my career i have covered a series of failures
8231, 0 ### but that reality is expunged from our policy making process
8232, 0 ### we're really good at talking about skills and safety and health we're really bad at talking about character
8233, 0 ### and the giant in the field is in the room tonight and is speaking tomorrow morning antonio
8234, 0 ### and the brain scans were identical in both activities
8235, 0 ### we emerge out of relationships and we are deeply one with another
8236, 0 ### we believe that reason is the highest of the faculties
8237, 0 ### the first gift or talent is the ability to enter into other people's minds and learn what they have to offer
8239, 1 ### for example when rosie a little girl who spoke only spanish moved in next door brianna who spoke only english borrowed her mother's tablet and found a translation app so the two of them could communicate
8240, 1 ### as you walk in the door greets you with a welcome black home
8241, 1 ### if i had a little extra money i'd buy a hostess fruit pie
8243, 1 ### and i'm not being modest or self deprecating i am amazing
8244, 1 ### a whole venture capital industry has grown up around the belief that if people have good ideas and the desire to manifest them we should give them lots and lots and lots of money
8245, 0 ### but it's not enough
8246, 0 ### child care is expensive more than they'd earn in a job
8248, 0 ### for the kids in the neighborhood it's a place to go after school to get help with homework
8249, 0 ### i have worked with young people who manifest hope and promise despite being at the effect of racist discipline practices in their schools and police violence in their communities
8251, 0 ### my daughter is not even allowed to turn on the stove unless there's a grown up at home and she doesn't have to because she does not have to have the same kind of self reliance that i had to at her age
8252, 1 ### it's a seductive place isn't it i don't live there
8253, 1 ### and third the has an ineffable charm a pleasant look and feel a je ne sais
8255, 1 ### by the time i left i was golfing at least three times a week
8256, 1 ### i also went fishing
8257, 0 ### i made detailed spreadsheets of all the power brokers in the communities who i needed to meet where i needed to be and i threw myself with gusto in these communities
8259, 0 ### in fact it is said north idaho has more gun dealers than gas stations
8260, 0 ### in north idaho in my red pickup truck i kept a
8261, 0 ### and i learned in how a country can have racism without racists
8264, 1 ### we're still waiting to hear back
8265, 1 ### a paint company donated a thousand liters of yellow paint mixed especially for us in what they now call optimistic yellow
8266, 0 ### our sense of otherness grows and we lose empathy
8268, 1 ### can you imagine of course my brothers were not happy about it and later i noticed they were not there whenever i needed them
8271, 1 ### you gained pounds since yesterday take apple instead of chocolate
8272, 0 ### actually i love sports and i can play many sports like swimming skiing skating scuba diving running and so on
8275, 0 ### i could access newspapers at any time and every day
8278, 1 ### i decided to give this a little name which is longevity escape velocity
8280, 1 ### it's got to be philanthropic because profits distract biotech but it's basically got a percent chance i think of succeeding in this
8283, 1 ### that means that i'm one of your subjects to become a old if you lose a bit of weight
8284, 0 ### i'm going to talk about feasibility as well of course
8287, 0 ### and this is actually a rather good comparison it seems to me
8288, 0 ### i don't agree with those answers
8291, 0 ### and the fundamental reason i think why we feel that aging is inevitable is summed up in a definition of aging that i'm giving here
8292, 1 ### i would take camera led lights and a bungee cord and strap it on my waist and i would videotape my belly button get a different perspective and see what it does
8293, 0 ### i wanted to collect more different types of eyes so i built this device using bicycle helmets some lightbulbs and television sets
8294, 1 ### public singing whole different thing
8295, 1 ### i sort of lived with this idea that when i'm grown i'll have learned to speak french and when i'm grown i'll learn how to manage my money and when i'm grown i won't have a stutter and then i'll be able to public speak and maybe be the prime minister and anything's possible and you know
8296, 1 ### i'm pretty sure that i'm grown now
8297, 1 ### for me the worst thing that can happen is meeting another
8298, 1 ### imagine my horror when i realized he thought i was making fun of him
8299, 1 ### people think i'm drunk all the time
8300, 1 ### but with people's names you can't change them
8301, 1 ### so after a few instances of this steve happily became seve and we got through it that way
8302, 0 ### i'm not on fire
8303, 0 ### it's not about mythology or myself to you
8310, 1 ### and b i hate them and i'm terrified of the power they hold
8311, 1 ### so for the last years i've been taking pads of this paper tons of this stuff and smuggling it into the stationery supplies of the united states and the coalition governments
8313, 0 ### that number is in stark contrast with the us service members who died during that same window of time
8314, 0 ### it's actually part of an ongoing art project
8315, 0 ### you can help to smuggle this civilian body count into government archives
8328, 1 ### that one's actually true
8329, 1 ### i guess people don't talk to their uber drivers
8330, 1 ### and so later i got married and like all good egyptians started my career as an engineer
8331, 0 ### and i'm a practicing spiritual muslim
8332, 0 ### i didn't just passively accept the faith of my parents
8334, 1 ### so i shelved it and i made this other movie about a big ship that sinks
8335, 1 ### and i talked them into funding an expedition
8336, 0 ### but it was all about trying to understand the world understand the limits of possibility
8337, 0 ### and i found that because there weren't video games and this saturation of movies and all of this imagery in the media landscape i had to create these images in my head
8338, 1 ### as you can probably well imagine i was a strange child
8340, 0 ### for example no one can do two notes at the same time
8341, 0 ### and i'm going to show you what it can do
8342, 1 ### and so that isn't very hard
8344, 1 ### and i said that's kind of too bad because we need million units a year
8345, 1 ### it's a little bit like an obese person having to use most of their energy to move their obesity
8346, 1 ### seven countries
8347, 1 ### not one single post office truck is stolen
8348, 1 ### the only criticism and people really don't want to criticize this because it is a humanitarian effort a nonprofit effort and to criticize it is a little bit stupid actually
8349, 0 ### i didn't quit the media lab i stepped down as chairman which was a kind of ridiculous title but someone else has taken it on and one of the things you can do as a professor is you stay on as a professor
8350, 0 ### but it was really through teaching
8351, 0 ### we were in senegal
8353, 0 ### and they really preferred that the money would be used for higher salaries more schools whatever
8355, 0 ### i mean you're looking at the sales team
8356, 1 ### in his way he speaks english as well
8357, 0 ### and in addition to that it's been predicted that at the end of the century almost all of the languages that exist now there are about will no longer be spoken
8358, 1 ### that's it for them
8359, 1 ### and i know how colony size changes as a function of colony age because i've dug up colonies of known age and counted all the ants
8360, 0 ### there are about species of ants
8361, 0 ### and i try to figure out how that works
8362, 1 ### it's very gratifying to have this kind of reception here
8363, 0 ### it doesn't make any difference because the only thing that ought to limit the performance of a system like this one is the number of pixels on your screen at any given moment
8364, 1 ### i know it's very frightening try to remain calm
8368, 0 ### middle eastern male with a backpack
8370, 1 ### and in fact to understand it i eventually had to create a whole new kind of science
8371, 1 ### so far so good
8376, 0 ### well i have to admit actually that i also had a very selfish reason for building i wanted to use it myself a bit like galileo got to use his telescope years ago
8378, 0 ### let's just do a little mathematical experiment try and find out
8380, 1 ### and as i have shown earlier our robot took the sentences from the textbooks and combined them together and it to produce an essay without understanding a thing
8382, 1 ### even more weird but probably this is the most fun part for the machine
8384, 0 ### and others may say no never
8387, 1 ### and it works look at these headlines
8389, 0 ### so in short i'm startled by all the things that they don't have
8390, 0 ### but i think as a community we still have a lot to learn
8393, 1 ### and then a delicate dance between dinner and death the is consumed by the ants they become mummified and a mushroom pops out of their head
8395, 0 ### so i hope to pierce that prejudice forever with this group
8396, 1 ### the leg room in economy is like business class
8397, 1 ### now i'm not totally opposed to light up shoes
8399, 0 ### i look around and see if there's a bin that i can turn upside down
8400, 1 ### that disproves that popular notion that if you're the smartest person in the room you're in the wrong room
8401, 1 ### he's getting out of san quentin in a couple of weeks and he shares your fervent desire that art should engage and enable people to connect
8403, 1 ### just remember as dave once said you can't succeed coming to the potluck with only a fork
8404, 0 ### remember i was young then
8405, 0 ### and indeed they were
8406, 0 ### what i'm asking you to consider is what kind of makers we might become because more than wealth or fancy titles or a lot of contacts it's our capacity to connect around each other's better side and bring it out
8408, 1 ### all right so for some of you this may be really really out there
8409, 1 ### first a burial suit infused with mushroom spores the mushroom death suit
8410, 1 ### and believe it or not a few people have offered to donate their bodies to the project to be eaten by mushrooms
8411, 0 ### and it's everywhere
8412, 0 ### and third our bodies are filters and storehouses for environmental toxins
8413, 0 ### it's then pumped with toxic formaldehyde to slow decomposition a practice which causes respiratory problems and cancer in funeral personnel
8414, 1 ### you're probably thinking that was my birth year
8415, 1 ### i don't have to worry about the bridge to where at my age
8416, 1 ### what happened i lost million dollars
8418, 1 ### one don't build a reformer on a fault
8419, 1 ### i'm teasing
8421, 0 ### so at that point we selected crude oil over whale oil and some more coal
8422, 0 ### and one trillion of that goes to opec
8423, 0 ### and with that we have found ourselves to be the world's policemen
8427, 0 ### but if you're going to do anything about the dependency on foreign oil you have to address transportation
8428, 1 ### so here's another example
8429, 0 ### and when you take a photograph with a camera the process ends when you press the trigger
8430, 1 ### and they also have learned how to lose gracefully without avenging the winner
8431, 0 ### and lima was a finalist in the afghan star singing competition
8433, 0 ### we've shown that you can actually reverse heart disease
8435, 1 ### in the middle of nowhere expecting there to be a place called someone built a place called new york
8436, 1 ### it had a gas station a general store two houses at its peak
8438, 1 ### and i was like i'll take that deal
8439, 1 ### and like all authors dream of doing i promptly quit my job
8440, 1 ### makes me nostalgic for the days when you could see the pixels in online video
8441, 1 ### germany because it had an alliance with austria told russia to stop mobilizing which russia failed to do so then germany mobilized its own army declared war on russia cemented an alliance with the and then declared war on france because you know france
8443, 1 ### they exist in corners of the internet where old men fear to tread
8444, 0 ### because then if my fake place shows up on your map i can be well and truly sure that you have robbed me
8445, 0 ### because the world would truly be a different place if north were down
8446, 0 ### but i do believe that while maps don't show you where you will go in your life they show you where you might go
8448, 0 ### i learned that the civil war was a nationalizing conflict i learned some physics i learned that correlation shouldn't be confused with causation all of these things by the way enriched my life on a literally daily basis
8450, 0 ### his name is ze frank
8451, 0 ### contrasted to the scorching desert that surrounds this place so are these people
8452, 0 ### follow the calculus tag on and yes you will see people complaining about calculus but you'll also see people re those complaints making the argument that calculus is interesting and beautiful and here's a way in to thinking about the problem that you find unsolvable
8453, 0 ### but you might ask why was the higgs included in the standard model alongside well known particles like electrons and photons and quarks if it hadn't been discovered back then in the good question
8454, 1 ### i've got a real one in my pocket if anyone would like to look at it and play with it
8455, 1 ### i don't take any drugs at all other than recreational ones that i would choose to take
8456, 1 ### they've really got to start talking to each other and exercise a bit of imagination if that's not too much to ask
8459, 1 ### translate that one i bet they can't
8460, 0 ### and as you can see my aorta dilated progressively and i got closer and closer to the point where surgery was going to be necessary
8461, 0 ### so i said to myself i'm an engineer i'm in this is just a plumbing problem
8463, 0 ### we went through an iterative process of producing better and better models
8465, 0 ### we don't need any of that
8468, 1 ### in fact i liked it so much that instead of making my own project i sent my mom links to about a dozen of these projects
8471, 0 ### so over the last several years kids around the world ages and up have shared their projects and i thought i wonder if of those three million projects whether anyone else has thought to put up mother's day cards
8475, 1 ### you should too
8477, 0 ### at first living in the van was great
8478, 1 ### or i'd make eye contact with everyone that was really creepy that didn't work at all
8482, 1 ### he would say you're right between horse and squirrel john
8486, 0 ### that was a big deal that was important
8489, 0 ### it's how you cover it that matters
8491, 0 ### now in design terms a wheelchair is a very difficult object
8496, 1 ### just type over it
8497, 0 ### nobody ever sits down and tells you this is how it works
8498, 0 ### hold down the shift key to scroll back up again
8501, 0 ### have a great day
8502, 1 ### and i'm not even talking about the american presidential race
8503, 1 ### make sure you pay attention to them
8504, 1 ### the other third didn't lie or perhaps forgot or you're lying to me about your lying which is very very devious
8505, 1 ### i used a stamp to defend canada's borders
8506, 1 ### anybody ever written on my way then you've also lied
8507, 1 ### and let's put aside the nigerian prince who's emailed you about getting the million out of the country
8508, 1 ### i'm sure you all have friends that have used online dating
8509, 1 ### in fact they lied about their height about nine tenths of an inch what we say in the lab as strong rounding up
8510, 1 ### you dominated the first group
8511, 0 ### you believed in your principles
8512, 0 ### let me tell you a little bit about a couple of new deceptions we've been tracking and documenting
8513, 0 ### you just didn't want to respond to that person that time
8514, 0 ### but they're very special
8515, 0 ### now the sock puppet on the other hand is a totally different animal
8516, 0 ### my favorite by jones is whatever else it might do it will touch your soul
8517, 0 ### chinese water army refers to thousands of people in china that are paid small amounts of money to produce content
8527, 1 ### so we have steve there one of the engineers giving the robot a hard time
8531, 1 ### and handle loves to put on a show
8532, 0 ### and that means i can move around in the world and expand the range of my arms and my hands and really be able to handle almost anything
8539, 0 ### ok you're welcome
8540, 1 ### as for me disillusioned by the failed religion of my youth i went to america and became a berkeley hippie
8541, 1 ### but before we get there we're engaged in a struggle between good and evil
8544, 1 ### bush remember him this is not a put down
8545, 0 ### when i was growing up i was told a story that explained all i ever needed to know about humanity
8546, 0 ### that of course was the meta narrative distilled from the theories of karl marx
8549, 0 ### adaptability meritocracy and legitimacy are the three defining characteristics of china's one party system
8550, 1 ### ladies and gentlemen that was in in the united states and i wish i had
8551, 1 ### men don't talk
8552, 0 ### i've been doing this for years
8553, 0 ### between and domestic violence among adult women in the united states has gone down by percent and that is great news
8554, 1 ### they were the ugliest looking men you can ever see
8556, 1 ### and you know koran says that if you learn the holy book the woman they can be a good wife and they can obey their husband
8558, 1 ### very happy and i was happy to be alive of course
8561, 1 ### we cannot only train women but forget about the men because the men are the real people who are giving women the hardest time
8562, 0 ### so i guess i was the lucky one
8563, 0 ### so i completed my education but i wanted to go to university
8564, 0 ### there were months years i didn't know about it
8566, 0 ### but i wasn't happy
8567, 0 ### and you know in the refugee camp when i went day to do a survey i found things you never could imagine
8569, 0 ### it gave me confidence
8570, 1 ### we grew up playing and used to dance together right yeah
8571, 1 ### that's how we met
8575, 0 ### i'm one of brothers and sisters from lakefield ontario an hour and a half northeast of toronto and we grew up on a farm
8576, 0 ### it became the only piano in the region and mom said she could basically play as soon as the piano arrived she could play it because she had learned all these rhythms
8578, 1 ### now became so successful in selling cars that soon she moved on to selling airplanes
8579, 1 ### and now i need to choose a sperm donor
8580, 0 ### now together with this we also have a belief in endless progress
8583, 1 ### her hebrew was not good and she later confessed that she thought that i had come to install the internet
8584, 0 ### i then rounded the very bend where his blue truck heavy with four tons of floor tiles had borne down with great speed onto the back left corner of the minibus where i sat
8586, 1 ### you'd think with a bunch of smart people we wouldn't be such suckers just for the pretty phones
8587, 1 ### it's fine
8590, 0 ### that's the kind of power we have because of all of the data that we have
8591, 0 ### i can look at your medical records i can see if your pump is still pumping see if you're good to offer insurance to
8592, 1 ### but second we have accidentally made it so that millions of workers around the world have unbelievably boring working lives
8593, 1 ### here robot process this painfully idiotic report
8595, 1 ### but on monday they're back to being junior specialist and systems analyst
8596, 1 ### we saw technology people being designers marketing people being architects and even finance people showing off their ability to write jokes
8598, 0 ### but if our politicians can't agree on things like health care or even school lunches i just don't see a path where they'll find consensus on something as big and as expensive as universal basic life income
8599, 0 ### the rate of change today suggests that we may only have or years to adjust and if we don't react fast enough that means by the time today's elementary school students are college aged we could be living in a world that's robotic largely unemployed and stuck in kind of un great depression
8600, 0 ### and it's not just because you know we are the one building the robots
8601, 0 ### to counteract this we have to start creating new jobs that are less centered on the tasks that a person does and more focused on the skills that a person brings to work
8602, 1 ### in the second group's scenario the walls are alive and actually give a group hug
8608, 0 ### that really involves designing behaviors and personality into products
8610, 1 ### now that is foreplay
8611, 1 ### million car collisions a year
8612, 0 ### i was on bowman lake in glacier national park which is a long skinny lake with sort of mountains upside down in it and my partner and i have a rowing shell
8613, 0 ### or and this is the fun part for me we want you to take us out into the natural world
8615, 1 ### but i was legally permitted
8616, 1 ### but you know this is how forest research in canada goes
8617, 1 ### and she started to chase me and i had my syringes above my head and i was the mosquitos and i jumped into the truck and i thought this is why people do lab studies
8618, 1 ### it probably reminds you of our own social communities and our families well at least some families
8619, 0 ### how do i know this here's my story
8620, 0 ### grandpa taught me about the quiet and cohesive ways of the woods and how my family was knit into it
8622, 0 ### so i went back to school and i studied my other world
8623, 0 ### i went to my first bag with the birch
8624, 1 ### she's the self declared mayor of village population eight
8625, 0 ### i just wanted to get the job done and get out of there fast
8626, 1 ### i'm also the first time here and
8627, 1 ### plays the notes a b e g and g that comes from the last name of one of schumann's female friends
8630, 0 ### so if i'm trying to do homework and i don't feel like it i'll try to draw or you know waste my time
8632, 1 ### it has a child running through a field or something like that
8633, 1 ### it has a space where you could have a bar mitzvah at the top
8635, 1 ### and so what we also felt was that whatever we did we couldn't do a cheesy for britain
8636, 1 ### this is the only project that we've done where the finished thing looked more like a rendering than our renderings
8637, 1 ### children one two three go
8640, 0 ### this is a shop for a bag company
8641, 0 ### and just very quickly something we've been working on very recently is we were commissioned by the mayor of london to design a new bus that gave the passenger their freedom again
8642, 0 ### and so we've been very lucky to have a chance to work
8643, 0 ### and openings seemed everyone loves opening bridges but it's quite a basic thing
8644, 0 ### it's just steel and timber
8645, 0 ### and what we found this area is one of the poorest parts of britain
8647, 1 ### and yogi berra used to say of course that it's very tough to make predictions especially about the future
8649, 1 ### you alter your looks and i'm told that not all of those alterations take place for medical reasons
8650, 1 ### because this is the ultimate
8651, 0 ### so this is the iron hand that belonged to one of the german counts
8654, 0 ### and if you can do that then you can begin changing fundamental aspects of humanity
8655, 0 ### you can have hearing in degrees
8657, 1 ### i don't have to check it
8658, 1 ### but this one it has a breath and a heartbeat and it feels very organic
8659, 1 ### oh now missed call a new call new girlfriend maybe very exciting
8660, 0 ### it's rich it tastes good it feels good it smells good
8661, 0 ### as humans we are sensitive to where an object in our hand is heavy
8662, 0 ### another thing it's good for is navigation
8665, 1 ### we ride our bikes to the grocery store
8666, 1 ### think about it
8667, 0 ### not only was i not moving a muscle i had no social interaction with the hundreds of thousands of people that were hurtling past me like me with their eyes faced forward and their music blaring
8669, 0 ### but there we were and it was kind of weird but it was really really powerful
8670, 1 ### we can flip lorries coaches buses anything over with a nitrogen cannon with enough power
8673, 0 ### i've been a professional stunt man for years
8679, 0 ### she said please sing for me
8684, 1 ### more arguing gold star on that one
8685, 1 ### when you make the claim in fact that something on the internet is going to be good for democracy you often get this reaction
8687, 1 ### someone put up all the cables from the state department along with software used to interpret them including my favorite use ever of the cables which is a tool for detecting naturally occurring haiku in state department prose
8688, 1 ### somebody put a question up on saying why is it that lawmakers don't use distributed version control this graphically was the answer
8689, 1 ### i think that's wrong but i think it's right for argumentation
8691, 0 ### all right so what all of these predictions of world peace got right is that when a lot of new ideas suddenly come into circulation it changes society
8693, 0 ### they had to quickly synchronize what other natural philosophers knew
8695, 0 ### they look like org charts
8696, 0 ### the programmers come and go
8697, 0 ### his point of view on this was very clear
8699, 0 ### but this is also the thing that brings the chaos back and this is second big innovation
8700, 1 ### i'll just stop here
8701, 0 ### and today the ideas behind this speech of racial equality and tolerance are so noncontroversial that my daughters study the speech in third grade
8702, 1 ### and of course everybody wants their own tower
8703, 0 ### maybe many of you have had this experience
8704, 1 ### this is the posture of ladies who are not this is the posture of ladies who are
8705, 0 ### this is one of the most popular viral advertisement of last year known as the optical inch by
8708, 1 ### this project which i call the enough already will mute the tv anytime any of these over exposed personalities is mentioned
8710, 1 ### this is called because there's an ball with a fi module in the plant and it's measuring the well being of the plant and it's creating a account where you can actually interact with the plant
8711, 1 ### or this is something that when the baby inside the belly of a pregnant woman kicks
8712, 1 ### or somebody made a chair that when somebody
8714, 0 ### and also this is part of a large community where there are thousands of people around the world that are actually making these kinds of printers and there's a lot of innovation happening because it's all open source
8716, 0 ### the documentation and the hands on teaching methodology is also open source and released as the creative commons
8717, 0 ### there is this magazine called make that sort of gathered all these people and sort of put them together as a community and you see a very technical project explained in a very simple language beautifully typeset
8721, 0 ### so we worked with a design studio called habits in milan to make this mirror which is completely open source
8724, 1 ### and we it with we are the premier science university in the world because of british like hubris
8725, 1 ### so why is it blue on cloudy days ah see
8726, 0 ### and they're questions that i've asked of science television producers of audiences of science educators so that's science teachers and also of seven and i find that the seven do marginally better than the other audiences which is somewhat surprising
8729, 0 ### and in the video a group of researchers go to mit on graduation day
8730, 1 ### and because the probability of me throwing it just right is very low given everybody watching me what we're going to do instead is show you a video that we shot last night
8731, 1 ### that one over there for example has aspirations to become a flying on broadway
8732, 0 ### skills learned include how to carry loads how to cope with disturbances and in general how to interact with the physical world
8733, 0 ### each flying machine uses onboard sensors to determine its location in space and onboard computation to determine what its actions should be
8734, 1 ### well here is one such way
8735, 0 ### just then with a loud bang the heavens opened
8742, 1 ### and the girl's going to notice me right here
8744, 1 ### she goes back to reading her book which is unfortunately titled rape
8745, 1 ### and we'll act as if it's just an unfortunate mistake we've made forgetting our pants on this cold january day
8746, 0 ### she doesn't know she's being filmed
8747, 0 ### that's exactly what i needed today and then exited without revealing what had happened and went in all different directions
8749, 0 ### we don't need a reason
8750, 1 ### you know hans the mick jagger of ted
8751, 1 ### and eventually they'll have evolved to such a high peak of perfection that they will make us all their pets if of course they haven't already done so
8752, 0 ### but he doesn't know whether it's an infection whether it's to do with malnutrition
8753, 0 ### he said he heard suspicious laughter
8754, 1 ### and i have to say if you think baby pandas are cute this is cuter
8756, 1 ### you just can't rely on the people out there to help you with this
8757, 0 ### but in the some countries caught up
8761, 1 ### so next time you are at a dinner party you might want to reach for this possibly neutral drink
8764, 0 ### but by the time we turn we will have all exchanged the neurons we were born with in that structure with adult born neurons
8767, 1 ### no one's laughing
8771, 0 ### people talked
8776, 1 ### just shout it out
8777, 1 ### you should have started with z
8778, 1 ### it also allows us to go to the store and allows us to get milk and eggs and cheese when what we're really looking for is red bull and bacon
8781, 0 ### and so i'm watching him and he slows down and finally he stops
8783, 0 ### it's more mundane
8784, 0 ### they're also able to reason at high levels
8785, 0 ### i want to see what happens with those words
8786, 1 ### there's a flying turkey under a tree
8787, 1 ### as a kid i knew them as calamari mostly
8788, 1 ### now here's a male on the left and a female on the right and the male has managed to split his coloration so the female only always sees the kinder gentler squid in him
8790, 0 ### and then this last one one of my favorites this design
8791, 0 ### here we're going to see one backing into a crevice and watch his tentacles he just pulls them in makes them look just like algae
8792, 0 ### here's an octopus
8794, 1 ### actually oregonians spend more on alcohol than most other states which may be a good thing or a bad thing but it makes you glad they're driving less
8795, 1 ### yet all of these innovations that's what they said in the brochure
8796, 1 ### short talk
8797, 1 ### i take some solace from winston churchill who put it this way the americans can be counted on to do the right thing once they have exhausted the alternatives
8798, 0 ### and there's an alternative
8799, 0 ### since then we've doubled the number of roads in america and we now spend one fifth of our income on transportation
8801, 0 ### the health argument is a scary one and you've probably heard part of this argument before
8802, 1 ### but mine really are
8804, 1 ### a little known secret in american history is that the only american institution created specifically for people of color is the american slave trade and some would argue the prison system but that's another topic for another ted talk
8807, 1 ### and then they'd say almost suspiciously but they're brand new
8809, 1 ### public education keeping poor kids poor since
8810, 0 ### wealth was never the primary ambition in our house
8812, 0 ### i wasn't supposed to have fully biology or chemistry labs school buses that brought me door freshly prepared school lunches or even air conditioning
8814, 0 ### blacks were kept out you know the whole slavery thing
8816, 0 ### close the divide by engaging in communication and relationships that matter
8818, 1 ### i'm a psychologist but rest assured i will not bring it to the
8819, 1 ### and apparently epstein aced the test therefore the article
8820, 1 ### the word is it's a combination of puzzled and pissed off
8821, 0 ### as they went from the first building to the second each of them passed a man who was bent over and moaning clearly in need
8822, 0 ### this studies the circuitry in two people's brains that activates while they interact
8826, 1 ### thank you very much
8827, 0 ### put simply i want to create a new reality a reality where technology brings us infinitely closer to each other a reality where people not devices are the center of everything
8829, 0 ### we've barely discovered charcoal and started drawing the first stick figures in our cave
8831, 1 ### ooh
8832, 0 ### it shows very well that eyes can hear and this is interesting to me because technology allows us to present sound to the eyes in ways that accentuate the strength of the eyes for seeing sound such as the removal of time
8834, 1 ### and that's what i want to talk about today
8838, 1 ### they expect them to evaporate
8839, 1 ### but what happens as this occurs is that we lose our magnetic field around the earth over the period of about years and that means that all these cosmic rays and particles that are to come streaming at us from the sun that this field protects us from are well basically we're gonna fry
8840, 1 ### obviously we don't want one of those
8842, 1 ### there's no reason why we shouldn't start now
8844, 1 ### what can we do about this and this is my scariest
8845, 1 ### the worst thing we can do is say jeez i got enough to worry about without worrying about an asteroid
8846, 0 ### so we went out looking for solutions to ways that the world might end tomorrow and lo and behold we found them
8847, 0 ### there are really serious calamities staring us in the eye that we're in the same kind of denial about that we were about terrorism and what could've happened on september
8848, 0 ### we are all much healthier than we were years ago
8850, 0 ### it's ridiculous
8852, 0 ### and the chance that some of it isn't more intelligent than ours is also a remote idea
8854, 0 ### they said we've been looking at the oceans for a long time now and we want to tell you they're not in trouble they're near collapse
8855, 0 ### there's really a tree like that out there
8861, 1 ### ok
8862, 1 ### but my friends it's so much worse than that
8864, 1 ### well that's wrong at so many different levels
8865, 1 ### in my experience the only difference between morning people and evening people is that those people that get up in the morning early are just horribly smug
8866, 0 ### if you're an average sort of person percent of your life will be spent asleep which means that if you live to then years will have been spent entirely asleep
8868, 0 ### you don't drink
8869, 0 ### all of those combine and they send projections down to the brain stem here
8871, 0 ### so there's good evidence for the whole restoration hypothesis
8873, 0 ### what's turned out to be really exciting is that our ability to come up with novel solutions to complex problems is hugely enhanced by a night of sleep
8874, 1 ### oh i thought it was funny
8879, 0 ### one of the national aeronautics goals is to develop the next generation of fuels using domestic and safe friendly resources
8880, 1 ### we're almost done
8881, 0 ### we can think of these very aggressive forms of cancer as kind of in a comic book
8882, 1 ### this looks very different than any sand on earth that i've ever seen and i've seen a lot of sand on earth believe me
8883, 0 ### but to really see the details of the bee and really appreciate what it is you have to look a little bit closer
8884, 1 ### i wanted to just talk for one minute about the future of biotechnology because i think i know very little about that i'm not a biologist so everything i know about it can be said in one minute
8886, 1 ### when people have this technology in their hands you have a do biotech kit grow your own grow your dog grow your own cat
8887, 1 ### so the farmers go out at night with heavily armed jeeps and shine the headlights and anything that doesn't look like a sheep you shoot
8889, 1 ### if we don't find them then we can create them ourselves
8890, 1 ### that would be a fun thing to do
8891, 0 ### the town was burned down it was in the middle of winter and it was a very very severe winter
8892, 0 ### and it's open to us to introduce a new way of doing that and that's what i'll talk about for minutes or whatever the time remains
8893, 0 ### it's not only cold but very dry
8894, 0 ### so we would love to explore europa to go down through the ice find out who is swimming around in the ocean whether there are fish or seaweed or sea monsters whatever there may be that's exciting or
8896, 0 ### it's quite likely that it would move out of the ocean onto the surface just as it did on the earth
8897, 0 ### you can imagine that the plants growing up like kelp through cracks in the ice growing on the surface
8898, 1 ### the only reason these people buy touch tone phones is because you can't buy rotary phones anymore
8900, 1 ### by the way he gave the i have a dream speech not the i have a plan speech
8901, 0 ### they're just like everyone else
8903, 0 ### i call it the golden circle
8904, 1 ### it's just driving
8905, 1 ### what we're really good at is basically wasting time
8906, 1 ### thank you
8907, 0 ### you can almost think of it as sort of like gravity
8908, 0 ### so we have many ongoing tendencies right now and i think one of the chief among them is this tendency to make things smarter and smarter
8909, 0 ### human pilots only flew it seven to eight minutes the rest of the time the ai was driving
8910, 1 ### and we feel like some of that difficulty was because of this false advertisement around parenting
8911, 1 ### we have charted our love for our child over time
8912, 1 ### but we like to joke in the first few months of all of our children's lives this is uncle rufus
8916, 0 ### sex begets babies
8917, 0 ### and of course they're not always crying and screaming but with three boys there's a decent probability that at least one of them will not be himself exactly as he should
8919, 0 ### and i was there with my arms open
8920, 1 ### i should be able to ask my house where my shoes are
8921, 1 ### the supreme court ruled last month that a policeman has to get a warrant if he wants to do prolonged tracking but the law isn't clear about civilians doing this to one another so it's not just big brother we have to worry about but big neighbor
8922, 1 ### they go on to jam innocent receivers for miles around you
8923, 1 ### here's ramon looking for a little attention from dad that week
8924, 1 ### here you are
8925, 0 ### it's hard to overstate the effect that this change in accuracy has had on us
8926, 0 ### but we now stand on the verge of another revolution in accuracy
8927, 0 ### imagine for example an augmented reality app that overlays a virtual world to millimeter level precision on top of the physical world
8928, 0 ### well these objections were perfectly reasonable a few years ago but things have changed
8929, 0 ### apparently an ex boyfriend of carol's from california had found her in texas and was following her around
8932, 1 ### you sent me to that place on washington street yesterday and now i'm covered in poison ivy
8933, 1 ### and there's two of me
8934, 0 ### this experience changed our lives and now we're trying to change the experience
8936, 0 ### we found pastor bob and offered to give the response some infrastructure
8938, 1 ### most people have
8939, 1 ### freedom if you're from new hampshire
8940, 1 ### and you might think well how can that be i mean a virus is you know it's stuff what's a made of yesterday was talking about viral telecommunications but what's a virus a virus is a string of nucleic acid with attitude
8941, 1 ### well it's not so surprising that they've gone extinct
8944, 0 ### there's nothing in it for the ant
8945, 0 ### it's a little brain worm
8949, 0 ### that's okay
8950, 1 ### by the way if you are a boy it's snails if you're a girl it's butterflies because what we found was that girls hate snails
8951, 0 ### now this tech incorporates three big elements
8952, 1 ### and then there was this mister splashy pants
8953, 1 ### well that got us a little angry so we changed it to fightin' splashy
8954, 1 ### people were putting up signs in the real world about this whale
8955, 1 ### everyone wants to hear their news anchor say mister splashy pants
8956, 1 ### mission accomplished greenpeace was thrilled the whales were happy that's a quote
8958, 0 ### this isn't about itself it's actually about humpback whales
8959, 0 ### we got behind it ourselves we changed our logo for the day from the alien to splashy to help the cause
8960, 0 ### this is that great big secret
8961, 0 ### and the cost of is so cheap you might as well
8962, 1 ### it's like santa claus without the seasonal restrictions
8963, 1 ### she could care less that these two women were signing posters and coloring books as snow queen and princess ana with one n to avoid copyright lawsuits
8965, 1 ### and as we walk in it is a scene i can only describe you as saying it looked like norway threw up
8966, 1 ### and let's be honest at that point i was pretty excited too
8972, 0 ### she never made eye contact with me
8973, 0 ### it doesn't matter to me
8974, 0 ### if you do not see that struggle that is unique to my human experience because i am gay then you don't see me
8975, 0 ### we are complex individuals swirls of contradiction
8978, 1 ### and soon they were all dancing this joyous exuberant dance right there on their lawn
8981, 0 ### they're open these festivals because like in minto they understand that the dialogue between the local and the global is essential
8982, 0 ### i saw their amazing show in new york at the staten island ferry terminal at rush hour
8988, 1 ### these are q tips stuck to my roommate with wig glue
8990, 0 ### and i became obsessed with this idea of blurring the perimeter of the body so you couldn't see where the skin ended and the near environment started
8993, 1 ### this one is called on donating my brain to science
8997, 0 ### you've swallowed hard the contents of the drink me bottle and felt yourself shrink
9000, 1 ### i've got something to show you
9001, 1 ### and anyway italy won at the end
9002, 1 ### yeah
9003, 0 ### now today if you want to win the race actually you need also something like this something that monitors the car in real time has a few thousand sensors collecting information from the car transmitting this information into the system and then processing it and using it in order to go back to the car with decisions and changing things in real time as information is collected
9004, 0 ### if we fix cities actually it's a big deal
9005, 0 ### well our objects our environment is starting to talk back to us
9006, 1 ### maybe a pure form a single form of emanation that you could imagine would be all dome and everything we kept making was looking too much like an egg
9007, 1 ### you can imagine also that movement within a circle could mean movement and stillness like the cosmos something you see in many places
9008, 0 ### i could see it and i remember thinking wow
9009, 0 ### so in there was an open call for designs for the temple for south america
9010, 1 ### this was the worst month of my life
9011, 1 ### to give you a sense of the experience the article was called i think you're fat
9013, 1 ### as i say in my book i'm jewish in the same way the olive garden is italian
9014, 1 ### as you can imagine i spent a lot of time at airport security
9015, 1 ### so i wanted to follow that rule
9016, 1 ### and perhaps the clearest example of this is stoning adulterers
9018, 1 ### i did spend some time shepherding
9019, 1 ### so whatever you think of creationism and i think it's crazy they did a great job
9020, 1 ### i'm very proud because i think i'm the only person in america to out bible talk a jehovah's witness
9021, 1 ### that's how i hailed taxicabs
9022, 0 ### so they answered my emails
9023, 0 ### the second reason i undertook this is because i'm concerned about the rise of fundamentalism religious fundamentalism and people who say they take the bible literally which is according to some polls as high as or percent of america
9024, 0 ### then i went down and i read several versions and i wrote down every single law that i could find
9025, 0 ### but it was really interesting because i was able to make some progress because i couldn't believe how much my behavior changed my thoughts
9027, 0 ### and these are the ultimate
9028, 0 ### it's a remarkable thing
9029, 0 ### so this idea of sacredness whether or not there is a god
9030, 0 ### that's how they printed them in the old bibles
9031, 0 ### also thou shalt not disregard the irrational
9033, 0 ### and i failed miserably
9035, 1 ### okay
9036, 1 ### that is share your lunch
9037, 0 ### it's a handy dandy quote from hippocrates of the hippocratic oath that says the greater part of the soul lays outside the body treatment of the inner requires treatment of the outer
9039, 0 ### but of course affords greater throughput fewer accidents and an interesting model of social movement
9040, 1 ### and now you know why i'm fun at parties
9041, 1 ### you find muscular tubes modified legs modified fins as well as the mammalian fleshy inflatable cylinder that we're all familiar with or at least half of you are
9042, 1 ### because after about six months of me talking about this i think he finally figured out that i was really serious about the penis thing
9043, 1 ### and one thing kept bothering me and that's when they're functioning penises don't wiggle
9044, 0 ### and that's because we tend to think of skeletons as stiff lever systems that produce speed or power
9045, 0 ### before it can be used for internal fertilization its mechanical behavior has to change in a really dramatic fashion
9046, 0 ### and i already knew that animals like this earthworm indeed most animals don't support their tissues by draping them over bones
9047, 0 ### if you have fluid with no wall to surround it and keep pressure up you have a puddle
9048, 1 ### i don't know if you know albert but if you go to it says that he's the fourth most important psychologist in history you know like freud skinner somebody and
9049, 1 ### and this is what he came up with
9052, 1 ### i survived just so you know
9053, 0 ### that doesn't look anything like a horse
9054, 0 ### and i see that opting out that happens in childhood and it moves in and becomes more ingrained even by the time you get to adult life
9055, 0 ### and we talked about snakes i don't know why we talked about snakes and fear of snakes as a phobia
9056, 0 ### and he'd get them comfortable with that
9058, 1 ### but first i have a new invention here
9059, 1 ### i found out that salt lake city and san francisco were different
9060, 1 ### don't jump to conclusions now on how to behave tonight and so on
9061, 0 ### now you can see united states in had a very low percentage infected but due to the big population still a sizable bubble
9062, 0 ### look india got many infected but had a low level
9063, 0 ### it means to million people the whole of california every person that's more or less what we have today in the world
9065, 1 ### and if any of you have ever driven on an italian highway you'll have a pretty good idea of how fast i was going
9066, 1 ### but i've also over the last year or so got in touch with my inner tortoise
9067, 0 ### and even things that are by their very nature slow we try and speed them up too
9069, 0 ### and this went on for some time until i caught myself scanning a newspaper article with tips for fast people
9071, 1 ### four months later i was back up on a snowboard although things didn't go quite as expected my knees and my ankles wouldn't bend and at one point i traumatized all the skiers on the chair lift when i fell and my legs still attached to my snowboard went flying down the mountain and i was on top of the mountain still
9072, 0 ### with this job all i needed were my hands and my massage table by my side and i could go anywhere
9074, 1 ### episodes on sunday paralyzed with fear at coming to talk to you
9076, 1 ### you know i looked at the map i picked out sites i figured no problem
9077, 1 ### but the reason i like to show the shot is because you can see that he's about to solve this problem
9078, 1 ### and here's a shot of me this is the before shot of me
9079, 0 ### so i have a couple of really important questions for you
9080, 0 ### nevertheless we spend the vast majority of our energy focused on this level of the pyramid trying to tackle things that are already completely adapted to human beings that are going to be very very difficult to address as we've seen in the case of
9081, 0 ### this was absolutely key for us
9082, 1 ### so we're going to immerse ourselves in the percent of the planet because you know it's really naive to think that the easter bunny put all the resources on the continents
9083, 1 ### the pilot made this great observation that's hot
9084, 1 ### three hours of bottom time average distance traveled one mile
9086, 0 ### it's in noaa the national oceanic and atmospheric administration
9088, 0 ### i'm going to make it right now in case i forget
9089, 0 ### in today's context it was a bunch of crap but it was the law of geology vertical tectonics
9091, 1 ### but then we had a meeting with a chinese businessman who saw our design and said wow that's the chinese character for the word
9092, 1 ### we scaled the building up three times to chinese proportions and went to china
9095, 1 ### that can actually hardly be seen from the canal tours
9098, 1 ### but if the chinese government intervenes it might even be a panda
9099, 1 ### then we sort of cut up the volume so we wouldn't block the view from my apartment
9100, 1 ### it's actually a stand up product from switzerland because in switzerland they have a natural need for diagonal elevators
9101, 1 ### this was the director of the bank when he was still smiling
9102, 0 ### in fact i actually think that darwin is one of the people who best explains our design process
9105, 0 ### and we saw this guy
9106, 0 ### you're not supposed to fly on holidays because it's bad for the environment
9109, 0 ### but in fact the container ships go full of goods from china to denmark and then they sail empty back
9110, 0 ### when you go to the exhibition you'll see the mermaid and the pool
9112, 0 ### the wood of your apartment continues outside becoming the facades
9113, 0 ### so we took the commission
9114, 1 ### should have something like this in their lobby
9115, 1 ### now of course i can bring up a keyboard
9117, 1 ### it's just so much fun playing around with it too
9118, 0 ### this thing allows you to have multiple points at the same time
9120, 0 ### i can do that grossly with both of my hands or i can do it just with two fingers on each of my hands together
9121, 0 ### of course i can do it with all my hands
9122, 1 ### it takes a lot of work to make these places look untouched
9124, 1 ### you just stop mowing your lawn
9125, 0 ### right now humans use half of the world to live to grow their crops and their timber to pasture their animals
9127, 0 ### i disagree with this
9131, 1 ### he comes for a tummy rub because he believes that will give me luck
9135, 0 ### and that rooftop did not have any ceiling only half a tin sheet
9137, 1 ### i want to be in that car
9140, 1 ### a couple of years ago i was turning and i don't like being
9141, 1 ### and when you're training for this sport you are not smiling
9143, 1 ### it was like an unit in the water
9144, 1 ### you need like a school of fish that would swim in front of you like this
9145, 1 ### and by the way a reporter called me the other day and he said he looked on and he said he saw my birthday was august and for some odd reason in they had my death date too
9147, 0 ### and i decided the remedy to all this malaise was going to be for me to chase an elevated dream an extreme dream something that would require utter conviction and unwavering passion something that would make me be my best self in every aspect of my life every minute of every day because the dream was so big that i couldn't get there without that kind of behavior and that kind of conviction
9148, 0 ### and i started to train
9150, 0 ### it's going to the east and you'd like to go north
9154, 1 ### marie curie i keep maybe saying marie antoinette which would be a turn up for the books marie curie third from the left on the bottom there she was allowed in but had to dress like everybody else
9156, 0 ### and when i was a second year undergraduate studying physics at cambridge i remember spending an afternoon at house in studying quantum mechanics
9159, 0 ### and yet it's not included in our cultural perception of physics and that bothers me
9161, 1 ### hence the mars watch
9165, 1 ### should i come home are you awake what time is it on mars and i decided ok so he needs a mars watch
9166, 1 ### this is david oh one of our flight directors and he's at the beach in los angeles with his family at in the morning
9167, 1 ### and one of the things that we all discovered is you can get anywhere in los angeles at in the morning when there's no traffic
9168, 1 ### so those of us who were on mars time would refer to ourselves as martians and everyone else as earthlings
9171, 0 ### so before we send people we send robots
9172, 0 ### so we have to think as if we are actually on mars with the
9173, 0 ### the blinds went down all over the building about a week before landing and they didn't go up until we went off mars time
9175, 0 ### and that was because again this eventually becomes hard on your body
9176, 0 ### what it means in terms of the distances between them how they will start to feel separate from each other and just the logistics of the time
9177, 0 ### so the next time you think you don't have enough time in your day just remember it's all a matter of your earthly perspective
9178, 1 ### today i'm going to unpack for you three examples of design and it makes perfect sense that i should be the one to do it because i have a bachelor's degree in literature
9179, 1 ### and you can tell it is a starck design by its precision its playfulness its innovation and its promise of imminent violence
9180, 1 ### and unlike the juicy it does not threaten to attach itself to your brain rather it simply attaches itself to your brain
9181, 0 ### when it was uncovered it ushered in a new era of streamlined futuristic design called which came to be synonymous with the jet age a misnomer
9182, 0 ### you can take it home with you unlike the theme building which will stay where it is forever
9184, 1 ### and to tell you the truth i never really bought into this argument in part because i never saw three american presidents agree on anything else in the past
9185, 1 ### but i think a much bigger problem with this is that this logic that we should be dropping not bombs i mean it would make a fascinating title for thomas friedman's new book
9186, 1 ### now it's all available online
9187, 0 ### so i'm graduating college and feeling very idealistic i decided to join the ngo which actually was using new media to promote democracy and media reform in much of the former soviet union
9188, 0 ### and i think by this news has finally reached britain so i should probably add gordon brown to this list as well
9189, 0 ### so the only way to control this message is actually to try to spin it and accuse anyone who has written something critical of being for example a cia agent
9190, 1 ### and that ladies and gentlemen is how the soap opera one life to live introduced a love story that lasted years
9191, 1 ### so i know my stuff
9192, 1 ### so with that let's start with soap opera lesson one surrender is not an option
9194, 1 ### so thank goodness for soap opera lesson four resurrection is possible
9196, 1 ### and so it went for years
9197, 1 ### so i packed up the kids and the brooklyn apartment and we moved in with my in laws in alabama
9198, 1 ### i was unemployed and living on the second floor of my in home and that's enough to make anyone feel dead inside
9199, 0 ### so tina still married but thinking cord didn't love her flew to argentina with max
9200, 0 ### now lots of companies fold at that point but tim chose to fight
9202, 0 ### life is not about you
9204, 0 ### now on tv those dynamic changes can make for some rough transitions particularly when a character is played by one person yesterday and played by someone new today
9205, 0 ### we can choose to draw a circle around our feet and stay in that spot or we can open ourselves to opportunities like carly who went from nursing student to hotel owner or like julia child
9206, 0 ### i had to be adaptable like carly and evolve my skills my mindset and my circumstances and then i had to be resilient like stefano and resurrect myself and my career like a phoenix from the ashes
9207, 0 ### thank you
9208, 1 ### it might be the only way to communicate with your kids
9209, 0 ### and this isn't some suburban using teen phenomenon
9210, 1 ### not like that
9211, 0 ### and this isn't just found in packaging
9212, 1 ### turns out it doesn't really make good business sense to sell someone a piece of land for eternity
9214, 1 ### i know
9215, 1 ### so i would definitely call myself a decomposition nerd but i am far far from a scientist and one way you can tell this is true is that i have often called the process of composting magic
9219, 0 ### i used to think that cremation was a sustainable form of disposition but just think about it for a second
9220, 0 ### in other words they're meant to prevent us from decomposing
9222, 0 ### we've created a non profit urban model based on the science of livestock mortality composting that turns human beings into soil
9224, 1 ### on a personal note we were pretty psyched when we figured this out
9226, 1 ### so this experiment looks completely ridiculous
9227, 1 ### so here's a quieter experiment where we filmed some earphones plugged into a laptop computer and in this case our goal was to recover the music that was playing on that laptop from just silent video of these two little plastic earphones and we were able to do this so well that i could even our results
9228, 0 ### but there's actually a lot of subtle motion going on here and if you were to touch the wrist on the left you would feel a pulse and if you were to hold the infant on the right you would feel the rise and fall of her chest as she took each breath
9229, 0 ### we thought it's cool that we can use software to visualize tiny motions like this and you can almost think of it as a way to extend our sense of touch
9231, 0 ### but it turns out that something can be invisible and still be numerically significant because with the right algorithms we can take this silent seemingly still video and we can recover this sound
9232, 1 ### and therefore i will limit myself to only talk about the links between religion and sexuality
9233, 0 ### and there are some people who say that the world population is growing like this three billion in seven billion just last year and it will continue to grow because there are religions that stop women from having few babies and it may continue like this
9235, 1 ### but you get me
9236, 1 ### good evening and welcome to spot the ted presenter who used to be a broadway accompanist
9239, 1 ### your call may be recorded so that they can collect the funniest dumb user stories and pass them around on a cd
9245, 1 ### i mean microsoft word was last just a word processor in you know the eisenhower administration
9246, 1 ### but if you're not careful about how you choose you wind up with this
9247, 1 ### you've obviously never opened all the but all you have to type in is this little teeny window down here
9249, 1 ### let's click next to continue
9251, 0 ### i'm listening to the sounds of silence
9253, 0 ### they're feeling like it's too much technology too fast
9254, 0 ### software is subject to another primal force the mandate to release more and more versions
9255, 0 ### and it came out and it was called microsoft write
9258, 0 ### you can't keep a good idea down these days
9260, 0 ### the lesson was simplicity sells
9263, 0 ### you walk along and i'm about to pull this onto the floor
9265, 0 ### they just said we'll make this software work right
9267, 0 ### bravo
9269, 1 ### i'm sure that resonates with some of the
9270, 0 ### it's about time
9271, 0 ### take a bite
9272, 1 ### and it's important to note that they're to scale so if you stand feet back and you can read between those two black lines you have vision
9273, 1 ### just go with me
9274, 1 ### you're going to remember that fact for like years
9276, 1 ### and new york city's number one word is now as in now i'm working as a waiter but actually i'm an actor
9277, 1 ### that's a day and i have them all
9278, 0 ### but there is one thing i know how to do i know how to program a computer
9280, 0 ### really simple idea you take every academy award best picture you speed it up to one minute each and string them all together
9281, 0 ### and so i this code to train a system on one person in our culture who would never need to be in that manner which is spears
9282, 0 ### i was there too with a film crew
9283, 0 ### this is the so called lansdowne portrait
9284, 1 ### they communicate electronically constantly and they have protocols and for how they handle everything from bad weather to emergencies or inoculations for the cattle
9285, 0 ### and then in the midst of all this came this new context for thinking about what it meant to be good
9286, 1 ### this song is called home and it's sort of a this is where i'm from nice to meet you all kind of song
9288, 1 ### and things got a lot more fun when the internet came around
9289, 1 ### one taiwanese production studio would interpret american politics in
9290, 0 ### it was ubiquitous
9291, 0 ### this man refused to fold to the conventions of normalcy and just decided to fold
9292, 1 ### and last is that we're more connected now to more people on the planet than ever before except for if you're sitting next to someone
9294, 1 ### in closing and as we're moving towards the end i just also want to encourage and i'm willing to share my failures as well though not from the stage
9296, 0 ### and third is that physical things are readable on a map so restaurants a variety of venues but also with and other technology like and it continues to expand beyond that we can also track things that are moving like a car a taxicab a transit system a box that's moving through time and space
9297, 0 ### they did not invent car sharing
9298, 1 ### she gave birth i caught the baby i got off the island i landed in san francisco and all the press wanted to talk to me because my three weeks on the island made me an expert in indian affairs
9299, 1 ### and i said yes i would do that so i became the doctor in an absolutely awful movie called medicine ball caravan
9300, 1 ### and then like everyone else in our generation we went to live in a himalayan monastery
9301, 1 ### this is just like a residency program for those of you that are in medical school
9302, 1 ### somebody reads very fast
9303, 1 ### but the joke is an epidemiologist likes to arrive at an epidemic right here and ride to glory on the downhill curve
9305, 1 ### i love it
9306, 1 ### these bad viruses really don't have any intention of showing up first in english or spanish or french
9308, 0 ### day one day two day three day four day five day six
9309, 0 ### by day nine you look at this picture and you're horrified i look at this picture and i say thank god because it's clear that this is only an ordinary case of smallpox and i know this child will live
9310, 0 ### i've probably had women die
9311, 0 ### but in that year smallpox exploded throughout india
9312, 0 ### so how we eradicated smallpox was mass vaccination wouldn't work
9313, 0 ### and in the process i learned something very important
9314, 0 ### we raised the reward
9315, 0 ### but smallpox was the fourth disease that was intended for eradication
9316, 1 ### now you'll get it you rascal was the response
9317, 1 ### look what i found
9318, 1 ### mostly they have the faces of our parents
9320, 0 ### this is the theme of my talk today
9321, 0 ### perhaps their art is something only their parents can bear and because they practice such art all day long people honestly get a little tired around kids
9322, 1 ### and then it was made worse there were two of them
9323, 1 ### and then there's little pretty of flowers everywhere
9325, 1 ### you should have seen the looks
9327, 1 ### there was a sort of idea really that if you owned a vase like this then there was really only one fate possible
9328, 1 ### i feel lucky in a way i've encountered this object
9329, 1 ### i love the fact that he seems to be going off to war having just finished the washing up
9330, 1 ### he's i hope a little bit dignified but mostly rather vulgar
9331, 0 ### leonardo da vinci's exquisitely soulful image of the lady with an ermine
9332, 0 ### about taking you from your own material world into a spiritual world
9333, 0 ### to see god's own plan in some sense
9334, 0 ### in the end i accepted the job without actually having been here
9336, 0 ### where i couldn't stop looking
9338, 0 ### so what you would have had were candles on either side
9339, 0 ### this is an object of the imagination
9340, 1 ### you know we all want to be someone who has watched but right now we want to watch ace ventura for the fourth time
9341, 0 ### it meant a connection to the world
9342, 1 ### but on a scale of one to for eyebrow raises if indicates that you've discovered a new particle this eyebrow raise is about a four
9344, 1 ### better than that my theorist colleagues i love my theorist colleagues my theorist colleagues wrote papers about this little bump
9346, 1 ### and then that bicycle explodes into two which hit our detector
9347, 1 ### i hope that's a non controversial statement
9350, 1 ### given the tone of the coverage you'd think that we had decided to shut down the and go home
9352, 0 ### then i would look at the stars and i would read about how well we understand gravity and i would think surely there must be some elegant way that these two systems match up
9353, 0 ### it all started when we at cern saw something intriguing in our data a hint of a new particle an inkling of a possibly extraordinary answer to this question
9354, 0 ### to discover new particles we need to reach these bigger numbers
9356, 0 ### gravity may seem super strong to you but it's actually crazily weak compared to the other forces of nature
9359, 0 ### we saw a weird looking alien bump on a distant mountain but once we got closer we saw it was a rock
9361, 0 ### but someone maybe she's in school right now maybe she's not even born yet could eventually guide us to see physics in a completely new way and to point out that perhaps we're just asking the wrong questions
9362, 1 ### the little boat in front of it was the one in which years later christopher columbus crossed the atlantic
9364, 1 ### this picture is really fuzzy i apologize i had a bad cold when i took it
9366, 1 ### new product from coke japan water salad
9368, 1 ### now i had tried to imagine what could possibly be in an animated tv commercial featuring tom arnold that would get you to get in your car drive across town and buy a roast beef sandwich
9369, 1 ### i don't want to get email from anybody i want to get
9370, 1 ### nobody
9371, 1 ### people are paying full price for both and the only thing they have in common is that they don't have anything in common
9372, 1 ### these guys make the loudest car stereo in the world
9374, 1 ### after you're cremated you can have yourself made into a gem
9376, 1 ### you don't have to like it but a tall dog made out of bushes in the middle of new york city is remarkable
9377, 0 ### but this guy named otto rohwedder invented sliced bread and he focused like most inventors did on the patent part and the making part
9378, 0 ### that what we are living in is a century of idea diffusion
9379, 0 ### the way the tv industrial complex works is you buy some ads interrupt some people that gets you distribution
9380, 0 ### two of the big success stories of the last years in retail one sells things that are super expensive in a blue box and one sells things that are as cheap as they can make them
9381, 0 ### they sold a billion dollars' worth of chairs by reinventing what it meant to sell a chair
9382, 0 ### they didn't want to buy his bread
9384, 0 ### and when you talk to them they'll listen because they like listening it's about them
9385, 0 ### talk to them and make it easy for them to tell their friends
9387, 0 ### the people who come up with stuff that's remarkable more often than not figure out how to put design to work for them
9388, 0 ### very good is boring
9392, 1 ### they talk quickly with a little higher pitch
9393, 0 ### and we wanted to call our pediatrician but we also didn't want to make a bad first impression or come across as a crazy neurotic parent
9396, 1 ### you know i've been buzzed in the water
9397, 1 ### that was my point with that
9399, 0 ### now it's not a bad place to be a researcher either
9401, 0 ### and it seemed that whenever there was a camera around or a video or film camera it was a great deal harder to do for those in power to bury the story
9402, 1 ### and at every day it doesn't matter who you're emailing or what you're doing the desks rise to the ceiling
9403, 1 ### this person will never see the email you just sent
9404, 1 ### you can email back in a couple of weeks or you can email someone else
9406, 0 ### it doesn't mean everyone goes in and eats dog food but businesspeople will use their own products to demonstrate that they feel that they're confident in them
9407, 0 ### at the end of the call the journalist threw in a question that seemed like a sort of softball
9408, 0 ### what's really interesting about the school is that percent of the kids who go there have parents who are high level silicon valley tech execs
9410, 1 ### this little syringe contains the moral molecule
9411, 1 ### we call them bastards
9412, 1 ### but interestingly high testosterone males are also more likely to use their own money to punish others for being selfish
9413, 1 ### and i took blood from the bride and the groom and the wedding party and the family and the friends before and immediately after the vows
9414, 1 ### give me a hug
9415, 1 ### of course if you don't like to touch people i can always shove this up your nose
9416, 0 ### and i personally am obsessed with morality
9417, 0 ### one of them told me paul that is the world's idea
9418, 0 ### in other words i thought i could design an experiment to see if oxytocin made people moral
9419, 0 ### now luckily oxytocin is produced both in the brain and in the blood so i could do this experiment without learning neurosurgery
9420, 0 ### so in these countries more economic transactions occur and more wealth is created alleviating poverty
9421, 0 ### so what we do in my lab is we tempt people with virtue and vice by using money
9422, 1 ### and secondly i'm a recovering
9423, 1 ### so it's actually than self love it's unrequited self love
9425, 1 ### buying it from us screams good taste
9426, 1 ### surviving the slammer do's and don'ts
9428, 1 ### and the odds are seven to one against your finding the prince
9431, 0 ### that's how you get rationality
9432, 0 ### and the object is the passive no voice
9433, 0 ### and so was humor
9434, 0 ### and then coming to this conference i realized that most everybody here shared those same qualities because really what trickster is is an agent of change
9437, 0 ### i like to think of what i do as a probability wave
9438, 1 ### what happens in vegas ends up on
9439, 1 ### management teams seem increasingly disconnected from their staff
9440, 0 ### and transparency allow companies to be in that room now
9441, 0 ### they can give them more control over pricing which is what the band did with its pay like online release of its album in rainbows
9442, 1 ### in i jumped the eiffel tower in paris
9443, 1 ### or this jump from a moving truck on the highway
9444, 1 ### we have to open a parachute just seconds before i would say impact
9449, 0 ### you can imagine with this big surface of a board there is a lot of force a lot of power
9450, 0 ### this is a jump i did in rio de janeiro
9451, 0 ### so for i'm training hard for my two new projects
9455, 1 ### staring at you
9458, 1 ### and this led me to thinking about three different kinds of nights last night overnight all night long
9460, 1 ### then past used to and the last one which is my favorite with the very romantic and dramatic notion to it once upon a time
9461, 1 ### that means to fall in love in international sign
9463, 1 ### good job everyone
9465, 0 ### yet i realize now that that wasn't the case at all
9466, 0 ### hence this drawing
9469, 0 ### so i decided to reclaim ownership of sound and to put it into my art practice
9471, 0 ### they help me to be heard
9472, 0 ### and the same holds true for a concept in
9474, 1 ### i was brought up like this i got used to doing it this way when i read a written word in simplified spelling my eyes hurt
9475, 0 ### neither the question nor the answer are new in the spanish language
9479, 1 ### the test step take a moment to think about yourself
9481, 1 ### this is the only thing i will say today that has no data behind it but i am convinced the longer it takes for you to laugh at this cartoon the more worried we should be that you're a taker
9483, 0 ### so givers spend a lot of time trying to help other people and improve the team and then unfortunately they suffer along the way

9530, 1 ### ten percent of people in the trial had this dramatic response that was shown here and the drug went to the and the said without a placebo how do i know patients actually benefited from the drug so the morning the was going to meet this was the editorial in the wall street journal
9531, 0 ### so this is an astounding table
9532, 1 ### alright
9533, 0 ### and that's absolutely correct
9534, 1 ### now baldness it's a terrible thing
9535, 1 ### we'll let those roam around the auditorium a little bit
9536, 0 ### so this morning i'm going to share two of these problems and talk about where they stand

9544, 1 ### and there were a lot of tents
9546, 0 ### well that's just the price of progress we say
9547, 0 ### we are now very comfortable imagining unimaginable technological achievement
9549, 0 ### it's time we set foot into that dimension and came out about the fact that we have dreams there too
9550, 1 ### he was always singing and making jokes and his daughters and sons saved me from his bull who wanted to attack me on the fourth floor
9551, 1 ### the bull saw me from the window and came out on the balcony
9552, 1 ### i remember how we got delayed on uncle house when his pigs that are bred on the rooftop were eating the sand bags that hold the lifts
9553, 1 ### and you keep going all the way to the top
9555, 1 ### and to be honest with you we could have finished earlier but i think it took us three weeks because of all those tea breaks
9556, 1 ### they say they are the ones who produce the garbage not them
9557, 1 ### the art piece at some point will disappear vanish and actually there is somebody who is building a second floor in front of uncle house so it's covering part of the painting so i might need to go back and paint over it
9558, 0 ### this event killed their livelihood
9559, 0 ### from outside it looks chaotic but everything is perfectly organized
9561, 0 ### he was the key of the project
9562, 0 ### it was really important for me that the community felt connected to the words
9564, 0 ### actually they live in the garbage
9565, 0 ### if you want to see the real image of somebody maybe you should change your angle
9567, 1 ### so we need to reconfigure we need to reunite the economic and the political spheres but we'd better do it by democratizing the reunified sphere lest we end up with a surveillance mad that makes the matrix the movie look like a documentary
9568, 1 ### but so is hayek that's why i'm a libertarian marxist and so is keynes so that's why i'm totally confused
9571, 0 ### and without democracy our societies will be nastier our future bleak and our great new technologies wasted
9572, 0 ### now let me give you two numbers
9574, 1 ### i mean it's not my problem it's your language after all
9575, 0 ### i would like to do a short test with you
9576, 1 ### it also happens to be male and in theory immortal
9577, 1 ### this is the yew no i'm just kidding this is the yew
9578, 0 ### the project is part art and part science
9579, 0 ### it wasn't until later when i was actually back home in new york that i got the idea for the project
9580, 1 ### i particularly like the little penguin in the back
9581, 1 ### a force more powerful is a video game that while you're playing it it teaches you how to engage in non violent insurrection and regime change

9590, 0 ### the most obvious visual thing on stage is the speaker
9592, 1 ### for the second phase of the trials we just had different sizes small medium large and extra large
9594, 1 ### and those are usually the basic scientists the bottom is usually the surgeons
9595, 0 ### yet we're still dealing with a lot of the same challenges as many decades ago
9596, 0 ### medicine is doing a better job of keeping us alive
9600, 1 ### he checked into a
9601, 1 ### they said these are pathological curves and we don't have to discuss them
9602, 1 ### so i got a fulbright scholarship to just travel around africa for a year asking people why they were building which is a great job if you can get it
9603, 1 ### so some of these things i'd wander around the streets of dakar asking people what's the algorithm what's the rule for making this and they'd say well we just make it that way because it looks pretty stupid
9605, 0 ### and there's no particular reason why we have to start with this seed shape we can use any seed shape we like
9606, 0 ### again we just take these lines and replace them with the whole shape
9608, 0 ### so here's a little fractal model for it
9609, 0 ### this is in the mountains near the nigerian border in cameroon
9610, 1 ### you don't like it shake it and you have a lesbian couple
9611, 1 ### i remember we cried profusely when the little goats we played with in the summer became
9613, 0 ### it's a little quirky and silly
9614, 0 ### you can draw as everyone should
9615, 0 ### it's a children's book about indian independence very patriotic
9616, 1 ### i could be as short as five feet or as tall as i'd like
9617, 1 ### so when i was feeling bad about myself insecure i would jack my height up
9618, 1 ### but when i was feeling confident and suave i would knock my height down a notch just to give the competition a chance
9619, 1 ### now i made sure to shave my legs last night because i knew i'd be showing them off
9621, 0 ### as you can see my legs are
9622, 0 ### a world in which the paralyzed could walk via body
9624, 0 ### we also took robotic tools here's a circle that goes around the biological limb
9625, 0 ### with this framework we've produced limbs that are the most comfortable limbs i've ever worn
9626, 1 ### they tend to prefer the puppet who has the same food tastes that they have and worse they actually prefer puppets who punish the puppet with the different food taste
9629, 0 ### the chair could collapse if you sit on it the apple might be poison the dog might not bark and in fact this is my dog tessie who doesn't bark
9630, 1 ### but lions are very clever
9631, 1 ### since i was a small boy i used to work in my room for the whole day and i even took apart my mom's new radio and that day she almost killed me but i learned a lot about electronics
9632, 1 ### the lights flash and trick the lions into thinking i was walking around the but i was sleeping in my bed
9633, 1 ### ca electric fence but i know electric fences are already invented but i want to make mine
9634, 1 ### you already tried it once right and you i tried it before but i stopped because it gave me a shock
9635, 0 ### they kill our livestock
9636, 0 ### and i think this is why the nairobi national park lions are few
9637, 0 ### as you can see the solar panel charges the battery and the battery supplies the power to the small indicator box
9638, 0 ### so i put the lights
9639, 0 ### so one year ago i was just a boy in the savanna grassland herding my father's cows and i used to see planes flying over and i told myself that one day i'll be there inside
9640, 1 ### weighing one to billion times the mass of our own sun these galactic black holes are devouring material at a rate of upwards of times more than your average black hole
9641, 0 ### here i'm showing an artist's conception of a
9643, 1 ### now she harbored all sorts of sentiments and emotions towards me at the time but love was not amongst them
9644, 0 ### now organized crime has been around for a very long time i hear you say and these would be wise words indeed
9645, 0 ### now it's time for full disclosure
9646, 1 ### goodnight sweet opossum
9647, 0 ### but really what they're doing is they're showing what's possible with technology today
9648, 1 ### so our metaphors equate the experience of loving someone to extreme violence or illness
9650, 1 ### in the book of exodus alone there are references to which is the word that the bible uses for the vengeance of an angry god
9651, 1 ### here we are using the same word to talk about love that we use to explain a plague of locusts
9654, 1 ### i must really be doing this love thing right
9655, 1 ### this study from used blood tests to confirm that the serotonin levels of the newly in love very closely resembled the serotonin levels of people who had been diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorder
9656, 1 ### and in fact and maybe you've heard this speaking going through a breakup is a lot like going through cocaine withdrawal which i find reassuring
9657, 1 ### that sounds terrible
9658, 0 ### falling is accidental it's uncontrollable
9659, 0 ### and to think this through i want to focus on one metaphor in particular which is the idea of love as madness
9660, 0 ### while i can no longer remember what that argument was about i very clearly remember how i felt watching him leave
9661, 0 ### we made up
9662, 0 ### but the good news is it doesn't always last that long usually from a few months to a couple of years
9663, 0 ### they argue that metaphors really do shape the way we experience the world and that they can even act as a guide for future actions like self fulfilling prophecies
9667, 0 ### or that relationship was shorter than i had planned but it was still kind of beautiful
9670, 1 ### they're not very well designed
9671, 1 ### today i'm going to show you four because i hope to have a competitive advantage at the end of this still
9678, 0 ### and that's ok right a lot of people are very happy with
9679, 0 ### there's nothing you can do
9680, 0 ### and it's going to be more important than the social layer and affect our lives more deeply and perhaps more
9682, 1 ### the age of the universe between now and the big bang is a hundred billion in dog years
9685, 0 ### that kind of makes sense to us
9687, 1 ### and i built silly things and i made plants dance and i attached them to my computer and i killed them all a lot
9689, 1 ### so i eat lettuce every day and i can tell the ph of a lettuce within
9691, 1 ### these are all the broccoli in my lab that day by ip address
9692, 1 ### it can talk to me it's conversant we have a language
9695, 1 ### he said there's no water in air you're an idiot
9703, 0 ### but it's not unique to japan
9704, 0 ### they go into the city
9706, 0 ### we want to see what people can create so we conceived of a lab that could be shipped anywhere
9707, 0 ### and so inside of this environment we're experimenting with all kinds of things
9709, 1 ### this is about twice the of the united kingdom soon will be more considering where this country is going
9710, 1 ### you got to question everything that is told to you including what i just told you today
9713, 0 ### she was my childhood friend
9714, 0 ### she also embraced violence
9715, 0 ### in the the turnover of the red brigades on a yearly basis was seven million dollars
9716, 1 ### so there's the guy on offense without the ball the ball and he goes next to the guy guarding the guy with the ball and he kind of stays there and they both move and stuff happens and ta da it's a pick
9718, 1 ### but for you we recreated that moment at our weekly basketball game about weeks ago
9719, 1 ### the crowd goes wild
9720, 1 ### i'm not going to tell you how many times it took us to make that happen
9723, 0 ### but there are things that for example basketball coaches want to know
9724, 0 ### we taught it things like passes shots and rebounds
9725, 0 ### basically things only professionals know
9726, 0 ### it really depends on the exact timing the distances the locations and that's what makes it hard
9728, 1 ### i won't go into details about what led to a decision i made but let's just say it involved alcohol cigarettes other substances and a woman
9729, 1 ### this man was very drunk and he was very interested in my camera until he noticed the women who handled him with smiles and at the ready of course
9730, 0 ### in i traveled to three war zones
9731, 0 ### in i went to liberia where a group of my friends and i did an independent self funded film still in progress on a very legendary and brutal war lord named general butt naked
9732, 1 ### and that is wonderful if you're in a forest and there's a bear
9733, 0 ### it's childhood trauma
9734, 1 ### so what happens here the second story also to illustrate another concept is called shifting waistline
9736, 0 ### and you'd think he was chasing finches but he wasn't
9738, 1 ### i enrolled myself in something called sexual surrogacy therapy in which people i was encouraged to call doctors prescribed what i was encouraged to call exercises with women i was encouraged to call surrogates who were not exactly prostitutes but who were also not exactly anything else
9739, 1 ### my particular favorite was a blonde woman from the deep south who eventually admitted to me that she was really a and had taken this job after she got in trouble down at the morgue
9740, 1 ### i've sometimes wondered whether i could have ceased to hate that part of myself without gay technicolor fiesta of which this speech is one manifestation
9741, 1 ### a friend of mine who thought gay pride was getting very carried away with itself once suggested that we organize gay humility week
9744, 1 ### you're four
9745, 0 ### my last book was about how families manage to deal with various kinds of challenging or unusual offspring
9746, 0 ### and that day my mom took me to the zoo and out for a hot fudge sundae
9747, 0 ### and i graduated high school without ever going to the cafeteria where i would have sat with the girls and been laughed at for doing so or sat with the boys and been laughed at for being a boy who should be sitting with the girls
9750, 0 ### building identity is about changing the world
9751, 0 ### she had sought meaning and made her travail into a crucial identity
9757, 1 ### ok so multi health systems is a software company and i hope that nobody here in this room ever comes into contact with that software because if you do it means you're in prison
9758, 1 ### many of you will
9760, 1 ### i'll have it out later for tech demos
9762, 0 ### he wants to engineer success
9765, 0 ### even the most data savvy companies get it wrong
9766, 0 ### so even the most data savvy companies amazon and they sometimes get it wrong
9767, 0 ### you put all of these bits and pieces back together again to come to your conclusion
9769, 1 ### in fact when i reported this figure in the one of our readers joked and said this figure is only shocking to percent of the population
9771, 1 ### now i am the first to acknowledge that statistics has got somewhat of an image problem
9772, 1 ### the official figures show actually it's nearer to three quarters
9775, 1 ### it was a long held ambition of mine to bring down a statistics website due to public demand
9777, 1 ### he got for his own area
9778, 0 ### if you look at the far end of this graph you can see the netherlands and korea are in single figures
9782, 0 ### so extraordinary variations and surprising to some but not surprising to people who have read the work of daniel for example the nobel winning economist
9783, 0 ### so at the statistics office while this was all going on i thought this was really interesting
9785, 0 ### i wanted everyone to engage with it
9786, 0 ### there are seven questions
9789, 1 ### in other words and i think you see where this is going no reason to live
9790, 1 ### very good
9791, 1 ### don't let the people counting down from interfere with your counting to
9793, 1 ### this will linger during the break so take advantage of the networking opportunities
9794, 0 ### that's okay because check it out i have math to prove that it is possible
9795, 0 ### i want games to be a force for good in the world
9796, 0 ### and that's what i want to share with you today the top five regrets of the dying
9797, 0 ### for example i wish i hadn't worked so hard
9799, 0 ### and stanford university has been doing research for five years now to document how playing a game with an idealized changes how we think and act in real life making us more courageous more ambitious more committed to our goals
9802, 1 ### now it's not always easy to push yourself and that's why they invented mothers
9803, 1 ### frank gehry said to me my mother pushed me
9805, 0 ### do it for love they don't do it for money
9806, 0 ### norman said to me i think it all has to do with focusing yourself on one thing
9808, 1 ### this man is wearing what we call a bee beard
9809, 1 ### the bees like it in the city
9810, 1 ### in honeybees started disappearing so suddenly like this little nerd kid going to school working with bugs became very relevant in the world
9813, 1 ### if you're not a flower these bees do not care about you
9814, 1 ### they'll say me flying around
9815, 1 ### now this was a mystery in the new york times where the honey was very red and the new york state forensics department came in and they actually did some science to match the red dye with that found in a maraschino cherry factory down the street
9816, 1 ### honeybees die when they sting so they don't want to do it either
9817, 0 ### he probably has a queen bee tied to his chin and the other bees are attracted to it
9819, 0 ### try to spot the beehive
9820, 0 ### you can see the orientation
9821, 0 ### we have tar paper on the rooftops that bounces heat back into the atmosphere contributing to global climate change no doubt
9822, 0 ### and looking back historically at the timeline of honeybee health we can go back to the year and see that there was also a great mortality of bees in ireland
9823, 0 ### perhaps there's more pollen in the city
9825, 0 ### they don't experience this
9827, 1 ### that's exactly what i do optical mind control
9828, 1 ### so it seems that the only trait that survives decapitation is vanity
9829, 1 ### you can think of this nagging inner voice as sort of the brain's equivalent of the catholic church if you're an austrian like me or the super ego if you're freudian or your mother if you're jewish
9830, 0 ### they say if we could record the activity of our neurons we would understand the brain
9831, 0 ### so you're looking at roughly one percent of the brain of a cockroach
9832, 0 ### but how an experienced code breaker will tell you that in order to figure out what the symbols in a code mean it's essential to be able to play with them to rearrange them at will
9834, 1 ### now one of the things about play is that it is born by curiosity and exploration
9835, 1 ### now this is a consequence of play deprivation
9838, 0 ### i think we may have lost something in our culture
9839, 0 ### but on the other side of that predatory gaze is a female husky in a play bow wagging her tail
9844, 1 ### i claim it was she says it was but it was one of those two years
9845, 0 ### they had an operation at princeton where they hired mathematicians to attack secret codes and stuff like that
9846, 0 ### i was
9850, 1 ### but then i suffered a series of career catastrophes one after the other and finally found myself in television
9851, 1 ### in the religious opinion religious orthodoxy is dismissed as self indulgent guesswork about matters that nobody can be certain of one way or the other but which makes people quarrelsome and stupidly sectarian
9852, 1 ### go and study it
9853, 1 ### i sometimes when i'm speaking to congregations about compassion i sometimes see a mutinous expression crossing some of their faces because a lot of religious people prefer to be right rather than compassionate
9854, 0 ### and while i found i knew nothing about these faiths at all despite my own intensely religious background i'd seen judaism only as a kind of prelude to christianity and i knew nothing about islam at all
9855, 0 ### the word belief itself originally meant to love to prize to hold dear
9856, 0 ### now pride of place in this practice is given to compassion
9857, 0 ### first propounded by confucius five centuries before christ do not do to others what you would not like them to do to you
9858, 1 ### and you learn until loops by repeating that sequence until mom gets really mad
9860, 0 ### my personal journey into the world of programming and technology started at the tender age of

9862, 1 ### they even hosted juice stations
9863, 0 ### for years the country has been divided between politics and religion
9865, 1 ### it's so much fun i have it in my house but i have it in the entryway i don't use it to make juice
9866, 1 ### the acid will ruin the gold plating
9868, 1 ### but of course then the ball hits the other side the ripples hit the poor fish they can't find any peace and quiet
9869, 1 ### and of course what's especially good is if you type design and emotion the first response out of those pages is my website
9870, 1 ### it will squirt you all around and you can stay in that shower for hours and not waste water by the way because it the same dirty water
9871, 1 ### the other neat thing
9872, 1 ### i'm only saying positive things from now on
9873, 0 ### it's a delight to use
9875, 0 ### oh well different story
9876, 0 ### the controls work wonderfully
9877, 0 ### intense fear paralyzes you
9878, 0 ### and then a psychologist alice did this wonderful experiment
9879, 0 ### still can't reach it
9881, 0 ### things work better because you're more creative
9884, 1 ### the standards have changed such that as says the typical road to a subdivision in america allows you to see the curvature of the earth
9886, 1 ### and this is the only bicyclist that i met in pasadena so
9888, 0 ### you need to do all four of these things simultaneously and that's the structure of my talk today to take you through each of those
9891, 0 ### it's so easy to understand the places where you only live the places where you only work the places where you only shop and our super sized public institutions
9892, 1 ### even these pictures and postcards of my london semester abroad years ago show that i obviously didn't care if i was perceived as weird or different
9893, 0 ### i told myself it was because i was growing up and maturing not that i was suddenly looking for acceptance
9894, 1 ### upright walking ape as it was found at lake on the west side
9895, 1 ### and it is one of the most special things to ever do with your mother
9896, 1 ### and then you hope that one of us lot will walk around and find small pieces of you
9897, 1 ### and here is a skull of a homo which i just pulled off the shelf there
9898, 1 ### the question now is well who are we we're certainly a polluting wasteful aggressive species with a few nice things thrown in perhaps
9899, 0 ### we are the species called homo sapiens sapiens and it's important to remember that in terms of our place in the world today and our future on planet earth
9900, 0 ### it's important to remember that we evolved
9901, 0 ### when we then find something very important like the bones of a human ancestor we begin to excavate it extremely carefully and slowly using dental picks and fine paintbrushes
9902, 0 ### but i was very lucky to have been brought up in kenya essentially accompanying my parents to lake in search of human remains
9903, 0 ### he was very able to use stones effectively as tools
9904, 1 ### but good thing i did because i don't look good in orange
9906, 1 ### then of course the next question is do you belong to any groups that wish to harm the united states i work at a university
9907, 1 ### don't want to make it look like i'm making any sudden moves
9908, 1 ### see that they won't let me on a plane with that but they'll give it to me on the plane
9913, 0 ### they're the ones who initiated this
9915, 1 ### but they also are very used to having to deal with patients so i'd say that they sometimes lose the idea that this is torture for you and that you become literally a patient patient means the one who waits
9916, 1 ### i actually had to hack it and that's a thing which we can talk about in another speech
9918, 0 ### and everyone changes as well
9920, 0 ### a cure whichever it is will have to deal with the whole of me
9921, 0 ### surgery the follow up showed luckily little to no growth of the cancer

10006, 1 ### from work or from home they took the day off and nothing worked in iceland
10007, 0 ### but i can surely tell you that in my country much like on wall street and the city of london and elsewhere men were at the helm of the game of the financial sector and that kind of lack of diversity and sameness leads to disastrous problems
10008, 0 ### and together we got through the eye of the financial storm in iceland without taking any direct losses to our equity or to the funds of our clients
10009, 0 ### but in at the height of the sub prime and all the complicated financial structures it was quite opposite to the reckless risk taking behaviors that we saw on the market

10049, 1 ### now the record at the time was and a half miles and for some reason this seemed totally manageable
10050, 1 ### i recruited my friend anne and together we decided we didn't even need to train
10052, 1 ### the explosion had been caused by a water heater so nobody was hurt and ultimately it was not a big deal but later skip came up to me and said nice job caroline in this surprised sort of voice
10055, 0 ### and to give you an idea of the suffer fest that i was undergoing the first lap around the high school track took minutes
10056, 0 ### and i became curious
10058, 0 ### and yet we adults act as if girls are more fragile and more in need of help and they can't handle as much
10059, 0 ### but on that mountaintop waiting for the wind to come in just right i felt so many other things too exhilaration confidence
10060, 0 ### now i'm not saying your girls must be firefighters or that they should be but i am saying that we are raising our girls to be timid even helpless and it begins when we caution them against physical risk

10078, 1 ### well yes you can if you move their food

10080, 0 ### for a couple of years i had noticed a rash on the sides of elizabeth's neck that looked like prickly heat
10081, 0 ### it turns out by chance this dermatologist also trained in ophthalmology
10082, 1 ### what you see over here this yellow thing this is not a death ray
10083, 1 ### welcome to the robotics mechanisms laboratory at virginia tech

10085, 1 ### and the actual goal of is by the year we want to have full size autonomous robots play soccer against the human world cup champions and win
10086, 1 ### and it's trying to show off its ability i'm macho i'm strong
10089, 0 ### this is an actual dynamic simulation animation
10090, 0 ### we call that the concept of passive dynamic locomotion
10091, 0 ### we had so many motors aligning the joints and those kinds of things
10092, 0 ### it stands for intelligent mobility platform with spoke system
10093, 0 ### and just by the tactile information it successfully crosses over these types of terrains
10096, 1 ### in other words we can't create supermodel mice
10099, 0 ### and this is actually what it looks like hundreds of blood vessels all growing toward the center of the wound

10102, 1 ### for women housework prevents breast cancer but for men shopping could make you impotent
10103, 1 ### it's like a consenting intellectual activity
10105, 1 ### but that's because people who eat fruit and and olive oil are freaks they're not normal they're like you they come to events like this
10106, 1 ### that doesn't mean it's the vegetables or olive oil
10110, 1 ### and i think that's the funniest epidemiology joke you will ever hear
10111, 0 ### these are from the daily mail
10112, 0 ### this one belongs to my dead cat hettie
10113, 0 ### so red wine can help prevent breast cancer
10114, 0 ### actually it turns out that your risk of breast cancer increases slightly with every amount of alcohol you drink
10115, 0 ### i'm going to tell you about one trial which is probably the most well reported trial in the news media over the past decade
10117, 0 ### that's an outrageous and ridiculous finding but it's true
10119, 0 ### you can give the competing drug in too high a dose so people get side effects
10124, 1 ### he used to keep a gorilla suit in the trunk of his car and he'd say it's for emergencies only
10125, 1 ### and i was like whoa i guess we get to say anything out loud
10126, 0 ### i was working as an internist and paul was finishing his training as a neurosurgeon when he started to lose weight
10127, 0 ### we learned directly how to struggle through really tough medical decisions
10129, 1 ### every night on the tv news now is like a nature hike through the book of revelation
10131, 1 ### turns out it makes a difference if it's cheaper than
10132, 1 ### and she had just put solar panels on her roof and she didn't understand the request
10133, 1 ### went and formed an alliance with the sierra club and they formed a new organization called the green tea party
10135, 0 ### that right now is the open sewer for our industrial civilization as it's currently organized
10136, 0 ### and the accumulated amount of man made global warming pollution that is up in the atmosphere now traps as much extra heat energy as would be released by hiroshima class atomic bombs exploding every hours days a year
10137, 0 ### the white represents normal temperature days are arbitrarily chosen
10138, 0 ### so we're having record breaking temperatures
10139, 0 ### and the scientists can measure the heat buildup much more precisely now at all depths deep mid ocean the first few hundred meters
10140, 1 ### much easier said than done
10141, 0 ### this is what a classroom in a public school in india looks like
10142, 1 ### the email itself was from another very sexy european type ted curator chris anderson
10148, 1 ### of course he was
10150, 0 ### the hour from night to day
10151, 0 ### groucho marx charlie you should have come to the first party
10156, 0 ### there's a very cute example here from calvin and hobbes
10157, 0 ### if this is confirmation bias there is so much confirmation i am biased
10158, 1 ### last year we did a dance in zero gravity and once we set up an obstacle course out of thousands of musical instruments in the desert and then played them by stunt driving a car through them
10159, 1 ### and i think the big contributing factor may have been that this is how i decorated my high school bedroom
10160, 1 ### so i was in this visual maelstrom just pretty much usually sitting in one place and i guess just the overload in general my brain kind of tried to make sense of it and i would if i could move my head off to one side a little bit the edge of the desk would line up just perfectly with that poster on the opposite wall or if i put my thumb out i could close first my left eye and then my right and my thumb would bounce back and forth between jimi left eye and his right
10161, 1 ### and what i'm trying to do is get that back there to stick out of her head like a ponytail
10162, 1 ### which is one ten thousandth of one percent so your chance for success is literally one in a million
10163, 1 ### we try to find a sandbox and then we gamble a whole bunch of our resources on getting in that sandbox and playing
10164, 1 ### it was like my was lines long and columns wide which i presume that if anybody is going to understand that it's this crowd
10171, 0 ### and when it does click it doesn't feel like you thought up that puzzle piece it feels like you found it like it was a set of relationships that you unlocked
10172, 0 ### and then with that plan in mind you go back and double check your original idea and maybe revise it and then bouncing back and forth between the idea and the plan the plan and the idea eventually you come up with a truly great plan
10173, 0 ### that was things that we had to have go according to our plan
10176, 1 ### and now all bets are off
10177, 1 ### now imagine someone as twisted as me trying to build a house
10179, 0 ### and so this is framing lumber composite materials and it's kind of hard to get the embodied energy out of that but it can be a sustainable resource if you use certified lumber
10180, 0 ### when it comes time to if you use it's about a quarter of the embodied energy of standard
10183, 0 ### i call this the alpha piece
10184, 1 ### he knew before he arrived that the foundation was going to be live streaming his event but what he didn't know until he turned up was that they'd erected a giant screen feed right next to his head
10187, 1 ### so justine chuckled to herself and pressed send and got no replies and felt that sad feeling that we all feel when the internet doesn't congratulate us for being funny
10188, 1 ### you are the worldwide number one trending topic on
10190, 1 ### and one internet economist told me that that meant that made somewhere between dollars and dollars from annihilation whereas those of us doing the actual shaming we got nothing
10191, 1 ### it didn't go down that well with some people
10192, 0 ### we could hit them with a weapon that we understood but they didn't a social media shaming
10193, 0 ### let me tell you a story
10196, 0 ### you know another woman on that night a new statesman writer helen lewis she reviewed my book on public shaming and wrote that she that night i'm not sure that her joke was intended to be racist and she said straightaway she got a fury of saying well you're just a privileged bitch too
10197, 0 ### justine was really uniting a lot of disparate groups that night from philanthropists to rape the bitch
10198, 0 ### employee in question currently unreachable on an flight
10199, 0 ### we knew something that justine didn't
10200, 1 ### and i would try and crack these jokes but she caught on to me really quickly and whenever i tried to make a joke she would look at me and say that is actually really sad
10201, 0 ### i loved her but with the ferocity that a child has sometimes before she understands that love also requires letting go
10208, 1 ### and i was reminded how utterly wrong i am so much of the time
10212, 1 ### you know aristotle says a tragedy is that moment when the hero comes face to face with his true identity
10213, 1 ### and i'm standing there with two testicles on my chin
10215, 1 ### and i talk to him
10218, 1 ### and he points out there
10219, 1 ### my responsibility is to get you home rich
10220, 1 ### good grief not to this crowd
10222, 0 ### i'm an apprentice and i work with the people who do the jobs in question
10224, 0 ### albert is the shepherd in question
10228, 0 ### literally the transition from ignorance to knowledge is
10231, 0 ### people with dirty jobs are happier than you think
10233, 0 ### he didn't follow his passion
10234, 0 ### so i started to look at passion i started to look at efficiency vs
10239, 0 ### you know our tools today don't look like shovels and picks
10241, 0 ### they're two sides of the same coin just like innovation and imitation like risk and responsibility like and like that poor little lamb who i hope isn't quivering anymore and like my time that's gone
10246, 1 ### hey we live in a very noxious world
10247, 1 ### step back give your mother a break okay
10248, 0 ### without them humanity cannot survive
10249, 0 ### and i walked up to the bedside of an old woman who was breathing very rapidly fragile obviously in the latter phase of active dying
10250, 1 ### that would be an olympic event turn a squirrel loose whoever catches it gets a gold medal
10252, 1 ### the uterus would literally fall out of the body
10254, 1 ### well emily baer runners she finishes in eighth place in the top even though she stopped at all the aid stations to breastfeed her baby during the race
10256, 1 ### i'm not ready
10259, 0 ### come with us
10260, 0 ### go
10261, 0 ### when you have two in one organism it's not a coincidence
10262, 0 ### when the arrived in north america you had two choices you either fight back and engage or you could take off
10266, 1 ### and in the words of malcolm gladwell crack cocaine was the extra chunky version of tomato sauce for the inner city
10267, 1 ### now was lucky he was such a freak and that clipboard probably saved his life because they figured no other rival gang member would be coming up to shoot at them with a clipboard
10272, 1 ### and you and i probably faced with the situation would think i guess i'm going to write my dissertation on the grateful dead i've been following them for the last three months
10273, 1 ### and especially for me as i sat in my office with my excel spreadsheet open waiting for to come and deliver to me the latest load of data that he would get from the gang
10275, 1 ### it's amazing but the top level of the gang they actually call themselves the board of directors
10276, 1 ### got to know very well the guy who had the unfortunate assignment of trying to take the iowa franchise which it turned out for this black gang was not one of the more brilliant financial endeavors they undertook
10277, 1 ### it turns out the death rates on death row from all causes including execution two percent a year
10278, 1 ### i think the gang member says it much more than the economist about what's going on
10280, 1 ### and it never would really occur to an economist that this idea of and could really be important
10284, 0 ### and for the people who were there running the gang it was a great way seemingly to make a lot of money
10285, 0 ### and in his own words he looked like a freak
10286, 0 ### he took one look at who was going to go do some surveys for him and decided he knew exactly the place to send him which was to one of the toughest most notorious housing projects not just in chicago but in the entire united states
10288, 0 ### and they're the ones who basically make the profit or lose a profit depending on how good they are at running the business
10289, 0 ### so the same kids who are working in the gang were actually at the very same time typically working part time at a place like mcdonald's
10290, 0 ### it was below the minimum wage
10292, 0 ### the money looks about the same
10293, 0 ### to put it into perspective if you compare this to the soldiers in iraq for instance right now fighting the war
10294, 0 ### so what happened was the people who happened to be in the right place at the right time the people who happened to be leading the gang in the mid became very very wealthy
10295, 0 ### they were willing to start at the bottom just like say a first year lawyer at a law firm is willing to start at the bottom work weeks for not that much money because they think they're going to make partner
10296, 0 ### and they didn't really have gold jewelry they had gold plated jewelry
10297, 0 ### let me do one last thing i hadn't thought i'd have time to do which is to talk about what we learned more generally about economics from the study of the gang
10298, 1 ### it's as if you reduced all of the world's cuisines down to airline food
10299, 0 ### these aren't palaces or cathedrals
10304, 1 ### right so when institutions are told they are obstacles and that there are other ways of coordinating the value they go through something a little bit like the kubler ross stages of reaction being told you have a fatal illness denial anger bargaining acceptance
10305, 1 ### and you can see why from point of view that's a bad idea right we hired this programmer he came in he drank our cokes and played for three years and he had one idea
10306, 1 ### right bad hire
10307, 1 ### now this is the part of the talk where i tell you what's going to come as a result of all of this but i'm running out of time which is good because i don't know
10309, 0 ### you found an institution and you use the institution to coordinate the activities of the group
10310, 0 ### some people get less dressed up
10311, 0 ### is a photo sharing service that allows people to take photos them share them over the web and so forth
10314, 1 ### if you're thinking it's ironic that i asked people to download another app so that they would spend less time on their phones yeah but you gotta meet people where they are
10315, 1 ### that is exactly the behavior that the technology is built to trigger
10316, 1 ### as one designer told me the only people who refer to their customers as users are drug dealers and technologists
10318, 1 ### so creativity i learned means different things to different people
10319, 1 ### i deleted the game two dots and nearly cried
10320, 0 ### i was one of the first people into belgrade when there was a revolution in serbia
10321, 0 ### i created my dream job hosting a public radio show
10323, 0 ### i updated my calendar while i was sitting on the couch
10325, 0 ### totally awesome right so this is my brain in an and i learned that in the default mode is when we connect disparate ideas we solve some of our most nagging problems and we do something called autobiographical planning
10326, 0 ### so switch switch switch you're using glucose glucose glucose
10327, 0 ### we also found strangely enough that the shorter the amount of sleep that a person gets the more likely they are to check
10329, 1 ### this particular reel it's an industrial video but it was shown in drive in theaters in in the detroit area in fact and it preceded alfred hitchcock's psycho
10330, 0 ### we use words like grasp metaphorically to also think about understanding things
10331, 0 ### there was one held in detroit here last summer and it will be held again next summer at the henry ford
10335, 1 ### and we have had a speaker who said that very thing and swallowed a sword right after that which was quite dramatic
10340, 0 ### ghana becomes independent so it is just over years ago
10342, 1 ### i don't know if he's bare chested but it kind of feels like it
10343, 1 ### so i ran on down to the junior college registered for some classes ran on back and basically was like i'm thinking about my future now
10344, 1 ### so when i randomly ran down to the junior college and registered for classes i really wasn't paying attention to what i was registering to
10345, 1 ### i got this
10347, 1 ### it was poorly let's just put it that way
10348, 1 ### when can we talk because we need to talk
10349, 0 ### there was so much history that we would have to go through to try to explain that and that's something i try to do with them anyways
10351, 0 ### i decided let me keep taking these art history classes
10352, 0 ### this is a really important chapter to me
10353, 0 ### above you right here on the slide is a painting by frans
10354, 0 ### he's trying to tell us something about the economic status of these people in these paintings
10355, 0 ### i want to show you something
10356, 1 ### sixty eight percent of mothers with high feelings of entitlement and self esteem identified with the dancing cats in a commercial for purina
10357, 1 ### i'm going to go ahead and say it out loud anyway are hideous
10358, 0 ### a few days later the scene was memorialized in a political cartoon back in washington

10360, 1 ### i also need alcohol and morphine because it's the only way i can work
10361, 1 ### according to his biographer he looked as if for the first time he had discovered there was evil in the world
10362, 1 ### if that belief turns out to be mistaken it will make a difference
10363, 1 ### this is why spouses in happy marriages tend to think that their husband or wife looks much better than anyone else thinks that they do
10364, 1 ### and in fact there's a thriving market in the partially eaten food of beloved people
10365, 1 ### as my wife put it you've washed away the clooney
10366, 1 ### she reaches into her purse and hands him a
10367, 1 ### but what i want to point out is you can buy this from
10368, 0 ### he went through europe through world war stealing extorting and occasionally buying various paintings for his collection
10369, 0 ### and at some point the dutch police came into amsterdam and arrested van
10370, 0 ### in particular the supper at emmaus which was viewed as finest masterpiece his best work people would come from all over the world to see it was actually a forgery
10371, 0 ### many sociologists like and wolfe would argue that the reason why we take origins so seriously is because we're snobs because we're focused on status
10372, 0 ### so i want to suggest that pleasure is deep and that this isn't true just for higher level pleasures like art but even the most seemingly simple pleasures are affected by our beliefs about hidden
10373, 0 ### few of you would eat it if it's a rat or a human
10374, 0 ### they believe mcdonald's food is tastier and it leads them to experience it as tastier
10375, 0 ### everybody of course drinks exactly the same wine
10376, 1 ### but i gave him the money because i was from riverdale so i had more money than he did
10378, 1 ### but you know we said david who's going to know they're not
10380, 1 ### and he noticed a large stain in the center of the rug
10381, 1 ### maybe amongst themselves they had a few good laughs but stalin was a paranoid man even more than my father
10382, 1 ### but in her lexicon sorry the rest unknown thank you is sorry the rest unknown go to hell because she couldn't care less
10383, 1 ### so and that's a song about how everybody's miserable because you know we're from russia
10384, 1 ### and she said i knew it was he
10385, 1 ### i think the family should open a store there and sell chocolate
10386, 1 ### and then my aunt frances dies and before she died she tried to pay with low packets for her bagel
10387, 0 ### so i was fortunate enough to be born a very dreamy child
10388, 0 ### and we started a studio
10390, 0 ### so i hopefully am writing you know books that are good for children and for adults
10391, 0 ### and the chair in the background is my favorite chair
10392, 0 ### it really scares me because my life is too random and too confused and i enjoy it that way
10393, 0 ### and with him i was able to do a project that was really fantastic
10395, 0 ### well susan this is a fine mess you are in
10396, 0 ### so what i did when i was painting was i started singing because i really adore singing and i think that music is the highest form of all art
10397, 0 ### i'm going to read quickly and probably i'm going to edit some because i don't have that much time left a few of the columns
10398, 1 ### i met kuwait's answer to bridget jones
10399, 0 ### pretty much all the titles on them were by british or north american authors and there was almost nothing in translation
10402, 1 ### of course sea cucumbers shoot them out their rears which in my opinion makes them much more interesting a superhero
10404, 1 ### so imagine a great white shark and a giant squid in the same bathroom
10405, 0 ### so you have to make a living cartooning
10407, 0 ### but that day i flew low over the islands it was a family trip to the caribbean and i flew in a small plane low over the islands
10408, 1 ### following are my opinions and do not reflect the opinions or policies of any particular prosecutor's office
10413, 0 ### near the end of my first year of law school i got an internship in the roxbury division of boston municipal court
10415, 0 ### and they all contained childhood trauma victimization poverty loss disengagement from school early interaction with the police and the criminal justice system all leading to a seat in a courtroom
10416, 0 ### the staggering inefficiency is what drove me to criminal justice work
10418, 1 ### i'm just going to throw this into an orbit and see if i can paint everybody's shoes in the front
10420, 1 ### this little boy is looking up at his father and he says daddy when i grow up i want to be a former president
10422, 0 ### there are a couple of reasons for this that i'll mention to begin with
10424, 1 ### i'd like to start my performance by saying percent of everything is crap
10425, 1 ### ninety percent of everything is crap so there's this to prove that sturgeon was correct
10427, 1 ### by the way you reacted i can see your lack of interest
10431, 0 ### now no no no
10434, 0 ### audience member the black card
10435, 0 ### he said it could be a high spade or a low spade
10438, 1 ### what i wanted to be was an archaeologist of the past a discoverer of literature an indiana jones without the whip or actually with the whip
10439, 0 ### in fact just before african scholars had collected a random assortment of old books and left them out for the terrorists to burn
10440, 1 ### in fact they're so well known that you might even recognize them in a slightly or somewhat different form
10441, 0 ### we had never seen our planet from this perspective before
10446, 1 ### so the best thing that happened to us so far in the medical arena in cancer research is the fact that the refrigerator was invented
10447, 0 ### i'm going to start by sharing with you a story about a good friend of mine
10448, 1 ### i gotta get back out my baseball ability here
10449, 1 ### people have used microscopes to look at the microbes that cover us i know you're not paying attention to me but
10450, 1 ### and i was getting up every five minutes to pee and drinking everybody's water at the table and i think they all thought i was a
10451, 0 ### that night i was taken into the emergency room and diagnosed as a type diabetic in full blown
10452, 0 ### and so we just heard about the sequencing
10453, 0 ### and that comes back to the diabetes story i was telling you
10455, 1 ### they would not leave me alone until i let them have a piece but it was not a good one
10456, 1 ### mr
10460, 0 ### in appearance he resembled mahatma gandhi minus the loincloth plus orthopedic boots
10461, 0 ### he had friends in high places who assured him that he was of great value to the economy
10463, 1 ### but it slightly bores me
10465, 1 ### i should say that my background my father was you know raised to be an episcopalian and republican but after one year of college he became an atheist and a democrat
10466, 1 ### and so i applied to and they turned me down
10467, 1 ### so we were told to build no more models we were incompetent
10468, 1 ### i have nothing to do no qualifications for anything
10469, 1 ### and i read it and it was just it was crap
10470, 1 ### so we were happy
10471, 1 ### so you know if it didn't work this way you might as well believe it because you didn't have any other scheme
10472, 1 ### it was really you know sort of a time
10473, 1 ### so there's a picture of francis and i before i met the girl so i'm still looking happy
10474, 1 ### and i'm smiling sort of forced i think because the girl i had boy she was gone
10475, 1 ### no use for it
10476, 1 ### ok
10479, 0 ### and oh that's the book little book
10480, 0 ### but wilkins you know thought was the best bet and he showed this x ray photograph
10481, 0 ### i mean in those days it was the domain of the physicists
10482, 0 ### not solve it like you know in rigorous fashion but build a model an electro model using some coordinates of you know length all that sort of stuff from x ray photographs
10483, 0 ### and certainly neither crick or i were chemists so we tried to build a model
10484, 0 ### he'll build a model and then we're going to be scooped
10485, 0 ### rosalind franklin was leaving in about two months and after she left he would start building models
10486, 0 ### and so crick and i you know started building models and i'd learned a little chemistry but not enough
10487, 0 ### he said they were wrong
10488, 0 ### the next five years there were essentially something like five references to our work in nature none
10489, 0 ### so that's the first cracking of the genetic code and it was all over by
10491, 0 ### and you can see on the top that cancers which are bad show or deletions
10494, 0 ### i witnessed my brothers and my siblings continuously stopped and frisked by law enforcement
10496, 1 ### seven years ago an even faster and cheaper american manufacturing technology was used to make this little carbon fiber test part which doubles as a carbon cap
10498, 1 ### we have real specific instructions here not to talk about politics
10500, 1 ### oh it's going to be so much fun
10502, 1 ### al gore invented the internet and because of that something that we used for a whole year excuse me a whole decade for fun became everything our commerce our research our communication and if we let the guys think for another couple weekends we can add a dozen more things to the list
10504, 0 ### it started in when the wright brothers flew in paris and everybody said ooh hey i can do that
10506, 0 ### i spent about seven years during the vietnam war flight testing airplanes for the air force
10507, 0 ### the most impressive airplane ever i believe was designed only a dozen years after the first operational jet
10509, 1 ### being that hungry has left an interesting mental scar which is that i've been up every hotel buffet that i can find
10510, 1 ### but as bob hope put it i feel very humble but i think i have the strength of character to fight it
10511, 0 ### so i've had to write some notes to avoid too much grunting and swearing in the next minutes
10513, 0 ### scott's last expedition the terra nova expedition in started as a giant siege style approach
10514, 1 ### every life form on this planet every insect every bacteria every plant every animal every human every politician is coded in that stuff
10515, 1 ### and it's beginning to tell us a lot about evolution
10516, 1 ### it will read like this
10519, 1 ### take a simple sentence
10520, 1 ### this is the way it should be seen
10522, 1 ### and if you want to get more specific it's actually specific zip codes
10523, 1 ### not integrated circuits indians and chinese
10524, 1 ### moderator two minutes
10525, 0 ### and when they were subject to the plague most people didn't survive but those who survived had a mutation on the receptor
10527, 0 ### and we're finding amoebas like this
10528, 0 ### this funky little thing people didn't used to think that it was worth taking samples out of nuclear reactors because it was dangerous and of course nothing lived there
10531, 0 ### i mean george bush he's going to be gone alright life isn't
10532, 0 ### they can't do it naturally so what they do with this thing is they take a spoon take some cells out of an adult mouth code take the cells from that and insert it into a fertilized cow's egg reprogram cow's egg different gene code
10533, 0 ### and when we learn how to close the gene gaps then we can put a full string of together
10534, 0 ### huge gene sequencing facilities the size of football fields
10535, 0 ### this changes all rules
10537, 1 ### no one put a curse on my mother's uterus and i didn't get it because my parents are first cousins which they are
10539, 0 ### or maybe not
10540, 1 ### they train their flying they learn how to recognize the food they will find in nature and they are able to socialize with others from the same species
10541, 1 ### on the top the turtles are just enjoying freedom
10542, 0 ### the good guys arrived took the cute mistreated animals from the hands of the evil traffickers and everyone lived happily ever after
10543, 0 ### so these genes are indeed going back to the populations
10544, 1 ### i prefer blood shift
10547, 0 ### national record attempt
10548, 1 ### andy andy how are you doing she said using the name of my older brother
10549, 1 ### early filer and late filer
10551, 1 ### so it turned out that starting a council of dads was a very efficient way to find out what my wife really thought of my friends
10552, 1 ### and when i have no more love left i just drink milk because that's where love comes from
10553, 1 ### i was like david cries when you invite him to take a walk
10554, 0 ### that's why they were called ape hangers
10555, 0 ### i was for all the world the walking guy
10556, 0 ### i have cancer
10557, 0 ### would they wonder who i was i thought
10559, 0 ### my wife as i said she grew up outside of boston
10560, 1 ### gupta
10561, 0 ### this one entered her left hemisphere and knocked out her area the speech center of her brain
10562, 1 ### the nearest land was antarctica and the nearest people would be those manning the european space station above me
10563, 1 ### that's what it's like in the southern ocean
10564, 1 ### no one wears trousers with a quite that high in this day and age
10565, 0 ### but the most amazing feeling was the feeling of freedom the feeling that i felt when we hoisted her sails
10566, 0 ### finally i bought a tiny dinghy
10567, 0 ### just like in my dreams there were amazing parts and tough parts
10568, 1 ### so basically china is a sick bric country
10571, 1 ### central cat and local cats
10572, 1 ### there is not only in china but also in the united states there are some very small cute but bad cats
10574, 0 ### in the north there was a great wall chang cheng
10575, 0 ### but if you think the is something like a wasteland i think it's wrong
10576, 0 ### so even though china's is a totally censored internet but still chinese internet society is really booming
10580, 1 ### my parents suffered through many more of my science fair projects including a remote controlled garbage can
10582, 0 ### the first stage was completed at home which consisted of the chicken grilling the chicken amassing it and preparing it to be transported to the lab
10584, 1 ### when it's degrees below zero
10591, 1 ### i have never forgiven him for that thing i made up in my head
10592, 1 ### i will be swimming around in you for the rest of your life i told my slightly horrified sister
10594, 0 ### and here's what i learned from laboring women
10595, 0 ### i'll never forget the magic that would happen when a woman stopped resisting the pain and opened
10596, 0 ### albert einstein called this state this dimension only being
10600, 0 ### we didn't have the kind of the relationship where we talked about the deeper stuff but like many siblings and like people in all kinds of relationships we were hesitant to tell our truths to reveal our wounds to admit our wrongdoings
10602, 0 ### i was paid in love
10606, 1 ### and i had this idea that camp was going to be just like this but better
10607, 1 ### i had a vision of girls sitting in a cabin reading books in their matching
10609, 1 ### so i couldn't figure out for the life of me why we were supposed to be so rowdy or why we had to spell this word incorrectly
10610, 1 ### and the vast majority of teachers reports believing that the ideal student is an extrovert as opposed to an introvert even though actually get better grades and are more knowledgeable according to research
10612, 1 ### but now all of a sudden my job is very different and my job is to be out here talking about it talking about
10613, 1 ### and i call this my year of speaking dangerously
10614, 1 ### just stop it
10616, 0 ### and i always sensed deep down that this was wrong and that were pretty excellent just as they were
10617, 0 ### a third to a half of the population are a third to a half
10618, 0 ### is more about how do you respond to stimulation including social stimulation
10619, 0 ### so if you picture the typical classroom nowadays when i was going to school we sat in rows
10620, 0 ### i'll give you some examples
10622, 0 ### this is especially important when it comes to creativity and to productivity because when psychologists look at the lives of the most creative people what they find are people who are very good at exchanging ideas and advancing ideas but who also have a serious streak of in them
10623, 0 ### now of course this does not mean that we should all stop collaborating and case in point is steve wozniak famously coming together with steve jobs to start apple computer but it does mean that solitude matters and that for some people it is the air that they breathe
10624, 1 ### i bought a fast car
10625, 1 ### i couldn't care less if clients ever called
10628, 0 ### reaching success i was pretty good at coming up with good ideas
10629, 0 ### and i got distracted by it
10632, 1 ### but sometimes i try to put myself in that position
10636, 1 ### and in fact you could say that the expansion of the empire was really sort of one long drawn out militarized shopping spree really
10637, 1 ### but anyway this is it's food at the center of life at the center of family life being celebrated being enjoyed people taking time for it
10638, 0 ### we live in places like this as if they're the most natural things in the world forgetting that because we're animals and that we need to eat we're actually as dependent on the natural world as our ancient ancestors were
10639, 0 ### by it's estimated that twice the number of us are going to be living in cities
10640, 1 ### and i gave up salt i went and i started taking huge doses of also known as
10641, 0 ### six years before that i was starting my career as an opera singer in europe when i was diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension also known as ph
10644, 1 ### he'd always walk up to his airplane in a kind of saunter devil saunter flick the cigarette away grab the girl waiting here give her a kiss
10645, 1 ### of course i always wondered what would happen if he'd kissed the airplane first
10647, 1 ### so my romance was temporarily shifted
10648, 1 ### she said but it's too high
10652, 0 ### it did mine
10653, 0 ### you had to learn about aeronautics
10654, 0 ### well the act of drawing airplanes led me to when i had the opportunity to choose a course in school led me to sign up for aeronautical engineering
10656, 0 ### and i couldn't choose airplanes because they had gotten sort of at that point even though i'd done a lot of airplane work on the interiors
10658, 1 ### so it causes a lot of inner conflict you know like part of me likes me part of me hates me
10659, 1 ### because if you only have the iranian passport you're kind of limited to the countries you can go to with open arms you know syria venezuela north korea
10663, 0 ### i was in dubai
10665, 0 ### and i got it in my head that all the indians must be workers
10666, 1 ### until you forget
10667, 0 ### in fact most people who get it don't even know they've had it
10669, 1 ### this photo taken just before his death is actually a no one reason this photo is interesting is because most people would not do this and if they did they would not live to tell it because fear would have kicked in a long time ago to a natural predator
10670, 1 ### i'll tell you when you can turn back
10677, 0 ### let me give you just some examples of how some powerful examples of how this has been used historically
10678, 0 ### these are disgust properties that are trying to be directly linked to the social group that you should not like
10680, 0 ### interestingly what they also showed in a finding that we kept getting in our previous studies as well was that one of the strongest influences here is that individuals who are very disgust sensitive not only are more likely to report being politically conservative but they're also very much more opposed to gay marriage and homosexuality and pretty much a lot of the socio moral issues in the sexual domain
10681, 0 ### let me just give you an example from a recent study that we conducted
10682, 0 ### and what we found was that just taking a questionnaire next to this hand sanitizing reminder made individuals report being more politically conservative
10683, 0 ### in the case of disgust what is a little bit more surprising is the scope of this influence
10684, 1 ### on average it was just a completely pointless exchange of money that i would regret
10685, 0 ### and so what i'm going to do is i'm going to pour wax in the ears of you and all the men stay with me so that you can't hear the song and then i'm going to have you tie me to the mast so that i can listen and we can all sail by unaffected
10686, 1 ### and please raise your hand if you've ever used tinder to help you find a mate
10687, 1 ### one's really hard to count because you're kind of going like this
10688, 1 ### but it turns out that the key social identifier is how much you're going to talk in the car
10691, 1 ### i distinctly remember telling my dad that i wanted to buy a navy blue secondhand peugeot on and he rightfully pointed out that the seller's name was invisible wizard and that this probably was not such a good idea
10694, 0 ### you got it ok
10695, 0 ### there are in fact hundreds of definitions of trust and most can be reduced to some kind of risk assessment of how likely it is that things will go right
10697, 0 ### our behaviors transform often relatively quickly
10699, 0 ### i am constantly stunned by major breaches of trust the news corp phone hacking the volkswagen emissions scandal the widespread abuse in the catholic church the fact that only one measly banker went to jail after the great financial crisis or more recently the panama papers that revealed how the rich can exploit offshore tax regimes
10703, 0 ### this first one internet zero up here this is a web server that has the cost and complexity of an tag about a dollar that can go in every light bulb and doorknob and this is getting commercialized very quickly
10704, 0 ### fungible goods in economics can be extended and traded
10709, 1 ### they know
10710, 0 ### it feels like the united nations here
10713, 1 ### you must be doing something right
10714, 0 ### so it was the spread of tuberculosis and the spread of cholera that i was responsible for inhibiting
10715, 0 ### i had been traveling to one country after another
10716, 1 ### i grabbed hold of it sat down and ate my breakfast with my pigs
10717, 1 ### this is the result of my hobby which is unofficial bin inspections
10720, 1 ### i thought my goodness what taboo have i broken how have i insulted my host he pointed at three grains of rice at the bottom of my bowl and he said clean
10721, 1 ### this guy has thrashed me at my own game
10722, 1 ### we knew that during the war
10723, 0 ### i went to the local baker and took their stale bread
10724, 0 ### so i took the food supply of every single country and i compared it to what was actually likely to be being consumed in each country
10725, 0 ### as a country gets richer it invests more and more in getting more and more surplus into its shops and restaurants and as you can see most european and north american countries fall between and percent of the nutritional requirements of their populations
10726, 0 ### a country like america has four times the amount of food that it needs
10727, 0 ### but what we have to recognize now is that we are reaching the ecological limits that our planet can bear and when we chop down forests as we are every day to grow more and more food when we extract water from depleting water reserves when we emit fossil fuel emissions in the quest to grow more and more food and then we throw away so much of it we have to think about what we can start saving
10732, 1 ### so that's probably a bit of a counter intuitive idea so i'll say it again let it sink in if we want to solve problems like hunger poverty climate change global conflict obesity i believe that we need to aspire to play games online for at least billion hours a week by the end of the next decade
10733, 1 ### this picture pretty much sums up why i think games are so essential to the future survival of the human species
10734, 1 ### this is a gamer who's on the verge of something called an epic win
10735, 1 ### first of all for children in the united states hours is the exact amount of time you will spend in school from fifth grade to high school graduation if you have perfect attendance
10737, 1 ### okay we can do that
10738, 1 ### you know jerry bruckheimer movies you form a dream team you've got the astronaut the scientist the ex convict and they all have something to do to save the world
10739, 0 ### some of you might be thinking that's a lot of time to spend playing games
10740, 0 ### this is a gamer on the verge of an epic win
10741, 0 ### good
10742, 0 ### but i also mean good as in motivated to do something that matters inspired to collaborate and to cooperate
10744, 0 ### they never give you a challenge you can't achieve
10745, 0 ### you guys have heard of leveling up strength intelligence
10746, 1 ### and up to around age or these functions are all intact and as i look at the young audience here in the room we're all still fine
10747, 1 ### so we teach them over several days to find this space on these cues in the space and you can compare this for humans to finding your car in a parking lot after a busy day of shopping
10748, 0 ### they didn't find it
10749, 0 ### but we usually have to wait until the person dies to get the brain and look at how it really changed through age or in a disease
10752, 1 ### great creativity can spread tolerance champion freedom make education seem like a bright idea
10753, 0 ### science is clever but great creativity is something less more magical
10754, 1 ### take a tune sing high when they sing low sing fast when they sing slow and you've got a new tune
10756, 1 ### spoiler alert unlocking your phone by sliding an icon with your finger
10757, 1 ### i'm going to destroy android because it's a stolen product
10758, 0 ### now the grey album is a
10759, 0 ### i think everything is a and i think this is a better way to conceive of creativity
10762, 1 ### is the country gonna make it will democracy flourish what scares you most what scares me most is is you lack of your engagement
10763, 0 ### the question now however is both about which form of capitalism and which type of democratic participation
10765, 1 ### we had to deal with images from films like the day after tomorrow
10766, 0 ### and the audience for such a long time was in a position where they didn't have any way of affecting news or making any change
10770, 1 ### but that doesn't prevent them from both being completely false
10772, 1 ### and that's despite the fact that a supernova is so bright so brilliant an event that it would kill you stone dead at a range of several light years
10773, 1 ### originally meant quasi stellar object which means things that look a bit like stars
10774, 1 ### it would be a bit like experiencing a supernova explosion but at point blank range and for millions of years at a time
10775, 1 ### or is it now actually that's just another parochial misconception
10779, 1 ### if you've been punched on the nose then the science of medicine does not consist of teaching you how to avoid punches
10781, 0 ### and that is how un typical this place is
10782, 0 ### that is the growth of knowledge
10786, 0 ### and the limiting factor there and here is not resources because they're plentiful but knowledge which is scarce
10787, 0 ### now i don't think that probability is the right category to discuss this issue in but i do agree with him about this we can survive and we can fail to survive
10788, 0 ### so let me now apply this to a current controversy not because i want to advocate any particular solution but just to illustrate the kind of thing i mean
10789, 0 ### so it's already too late to avoid it and it probably has been too late to avoid it ever since before anyone realized the danger
10793, 1 ### so look you don't have to like what they do but you do have to respect the entrepreneurial nature of their endeavors
10795, 0 ### there is also a widely held belief that by blaming an attack on a nation state you are putting regulators at bay at least for a period of time
10798, 1 ### the answer is the first poem was generated by an algorithm called that was created back in the and the second poem was written by a guy called frank o'hara who happens to be one of my favorite human poets
10799, 1 ### therefore according to the logic of the reverse turing test gertrude stein is a computer
10802, 0 ### have a go poem little fly thy summer's play my thoughtless hand has away
10803, 0 ### so let's try another test
10804, 1 ### if shivering is a form of meditation then i would consider myself a monk
10805, 1 ### i was hooked
10806, 1 ### and once we got there the vehicles were just as creative snowmobiles six wheel soviet troop carriers and a couple of super sketchy helicopter flights
10809, 0 ### the air a brisk with windchill and i could literally feel the blood trying to leave my hands feet and face and rush to protect my vital organs
10811, 0 ### but there was just this one problem
10812, 0 ### so if i was going to find perfect waves it was probably going to happen somewhere cold where the seas are notoriously rough and that's exactly where i began to look
10813, 0 ### and i told myself there's not a chance you're getting out of the water
10815, 1 ### any of you guys called kevin it's a major lift from being called kevin to be called conqueror of the classics
10816, 1 ### because when i rendered his sentence australia and china are enjoying a relationship of unprecedented closeness in fact what i said was that australia and china were now experiencing fantastic orgasm
10817, 0 ### his name is napoleon
10819, 0 ### it's happening persistently
10821, 1 ### so i spent the next years reading about crows in my spare time
10822, 1 ### and in return we just tried to kill them all the time
10823, 1 ### so keep in mind she's never seen this done
10825, 1 ### so that's the part where the researchers freak out
10826, 1 ### and they were entertained to discover that for the rest of the week whenever these particular students walked around campus these crows would caw at them and run around and make their life kind of miserable
10827, 1 ### until they finally graduated and left campus and glad to get away i'm sure came back sometime later and found the crows still remembered them
10828, 1 ### so now students at the university of washington that are studying these crows do so with a giant wig and a big mask
10829, 0 ### so i built the vending machine
10830, 0 ### and out of those nine tenths of the human growth population is occurring in cities
10831, 0 ### she's a new caledonian crow
10832, 0 ### now every crow within five kilometers is standing by a sidewalk waiting to collect its lunch
10833, 0 ### and as we heard yesterday that's the pandora's box that's getting human beings in trouble and we're starting to see it with them
10834, 0 ### and it uses training to shape their behavior over four stages
10835, 0 ### then they leave the machine spits up more coins and peanuts and life is dandy if you're a crow you can come back anytime and get yourself a peanut
10836, 0 ### they do that here and that knocks the coins down the slot
10838, 1 ### i mean look at them at the end of this movie you actually feel something for two pieces of furniture
10841, 1 ### instead they were all how should i put it they were all kind of robotic
10842, 1 ### and here when you see the robot interacting with me on a desktop and i'm actually redesigning the robot so unbeknownst to itself it's kind of digging its own grave by helping me
10844, 1 ### i actually participated in a play i hope no video of that around still
10845, 1 ### and i was really amazed because my name was the second name on the list the previous name was in
10846, 1 ### whatever that means
10847, 1 ### i think
10848, 0 ### and i learned two surprising lessons
10849, 0 ### we were folding up a lot of folding chairs and i was amazed at how quickly we found our own rhythm
10850, 0 ### you have to use your sense memory to reconstruct the emotions and kind of think with your body to find the right expression improvise play off your scene partner
10852, 0 ### and it's a little bit like what you might see actors do when they try to mirror each other to find the right between them
10853, 0 ### the other got more the stage actor risk taker brain
10854, 0 ### and i thought music that's the perfect place to look at teamwork coordination timing improvisation and we just got this robot playing marimba
10856, 0 ### now it's looking at me showing that it's listening
10858, 1 ### everything that smelling in here is made up of atoms that come from what i call the upper east side of the periodic table a nice safe neighborhood
10861, 1 ### how all right now when people ask this kind of question they neglect something which is that physicists are really clever unlike biologists
10862, 1 ### but it has a certain it has a certain ring to it which is attractive to people who read too much century german literature
10865, 0 ### and then will come what they call the heart the lush heart note
10867, 0 ### a very expensive high school chemistry education
10870, 0 ### you have a molecule coming in it gets into the protein which is schematic here and it causes this thing to switch to turn to move in some way by binding in certain parts
10872, 1 ### well i would really love to know what you would do on the first monday morning but here's what i did i panicked
10873, 0 ### but it is even more remarkable if you consider where we had been just a few years ago
10874, 1 ### and i say that sincerely partly because i need that
10878, 1 ### i'll tell you one quick story to illustrate what that's been like for me
10880, 1 ### driving ourselves
10882, 1 ### there was no motorcade back there
10885, 1 ### we went in and sat down at the booth and the waitress came over made a big commotion over tipper
10888, 0 ### but i wanted to elaborate on a couple of these
10889, 0 ### but they are also very effective in deflecting our path
10890, 0 ### at the current levels of technological efficiency can make this much difference
10891, 0 ### insulation better design
10893, 0 ### and what it means is elaborated at
10894, 0 ### integrate climate solutions into all of your innovations whether you are from the technology or entertainment or design and architecture community
10895, 0 ### become a catalyst of change
10900, 1 ### why did she say that because it was a line from our chinese parallel susan boyle a year old woman a vegetable vendor in shanghai who loves singing western opera but she didn't understand any english or french or italian so she managed to fill in the lyrics with vegetable names in chinese
10901, 0 ### well being different is not that difficult
10902, 1 ### now i could look at my hand for two weeks and i wouldn't feel any awe or wonder because i can't compose
10903, 0 ### i was at a ski resort in switzerland without any money to actually enjoy myself because the snow had melted and i didn't have money to go to a movie
10904, 1 ### well i don't know what you're thinking but i'm talking about the beards
10905, 1 ### i made a few changes let go of some loose trappings of my old life and through a bit of a leap of logic decided to row across the atlantic ocean
10906, 0 ### we have a bit of a thing going on
10907, 0 ### i did what people from my kind of background were supposed to do
10908, 1 ### so as good citizens we clean up the beaches and no he is not drinking alcohol and if he is i did not give it to him
10909, 1 ### and let me tell you kids with power tools are awesome and safe
10910, 1 ### we are so rapid at that the lunch is still in the when we're hacking it
10911, 1 ### so of course we didn't take the kids the parents wouldn't allow that to happen
10912, 1 ### we pack the sediment into small bags we then dispatch them to hundreds of small bags that we send to different universities and we produce the map of the seabed radioactivity especially in estuaries where the fish will reproduce and i will hope that we will have improved the safety of the local fishermen and of your favorite sushi
10914, 0 ### so we packed this prototype of a sensor and we shipped it to bangladesh
10915, 0 ### also it damaged the nuclear power plant of fukushima the nuclear power plant just by the water
10916, 0 ### and so the classroom started to feel a little bit small so we found an industrial site in hong kong and we turned it into the largest mega space focused on social and environmental impact
10918, 1 ### sebastian actually said to me he said thirteen former guests contacted me before my own mother rang
10919, 1 ### but i love that the number one task posted over a hundred times a day is something that many of us have felt the pain of doing yes assembling ikea furniture
10920, 1 ### now i love that word
10921, 0 ### i caught up with him recently where over the course of several cups of tea he told me how hosting guests from all over the world has enriched his life
10922, 0 ### it's a fantastic example of how technology is creating a market for things that never had a marketplace before
10923, 0 ### there is an host on almost every main street in paris
10926, 1 ### and i said i don't know actually
10927, 1 ### in other words they were all speaking like james tooley
10928, 1 ### he said two interesting things a teacher that can be replaced by a machine should be
10929, 1 ### as a result the teachers reported tremendous improvements in their english rapid improvement and all sorts of things
10931, 1 ### it's all in english and i'm going
10934, 1 ### so having experimented in all sorts of remote places i came to the most remote place that i could think of
10935, 1 ### and i explained to them that you know a lot of scientific research is done using that method
10936, 1 ### of them volunteered immediately
10937, 1 ### after watching eight he wants to become leonardo da vinci
10939, 0 ### i started in to try and address this problem with an experiment which was a very simple experiment in new delhi
10940, 0 ### this boy here in the middle of central india this is in a village where the children recorded their own music and then played it back to each other and in the process they've enjoyed themselves thoroughly
10942, 0 ### just mention i play games like animals and i listen to music
10944, 0 ### remember they don't study english
10945, 0 ### so i found that they had a friend a local accountant a young girl and they played football with her
10946, 0 ### just say to them cool
10948, 0 ### a single child in front of a single computer will not do that
10949, 0 ### you can't catch me
10950, 0 ### the mediator is from india
10952, 1 ### and so that means that technically this applies to like the back garden of your house in the suburbs
10953, 1 ### so the first thing that they tell you is that you need to have a certificate of burial before you can go ahead you're not allowed to just murder people and put them under the patio
10954, 0 ### now this is a real proposition and there are companies out there that really are offering this investment but my interest in it is quite different
10955, 0 ### in fact the majority are cemeteries
10956, 1 ### at that stage i just wanted to abandon the research but it turns out that democracy is a little bit more complicated than that
10957, 1 ### and that's great for the company and it's quite often great for the minister and it's not great for their country
10958, 1 ### if the british treasury can be out by a factor of think what the ministry of finance in sierra leone is going to be like
10961, 0 ### what i'm going to offer you is a recipe a combination of the two forces that changed the world for good which is the alliance of compassion and enlightened self interest
10964, 0 ### aid is part of the solution
10966, 1 ### although many of you already know that i do speak the queen's english because i am from queens new york
10967, 1 ### so feel free to think of this as sarah university
10968, 1 ### okay
10969, 1 ### but anyway
10970, 1 ### and she was getting a yogurt in the cafe
10971, 1 ### but even so a wonderful talent
10972, 1 ### anyway
10975, 1 ### and we were only years old so it was not appropriate
10976, 1 ### and there i must attend these meetings mingling with some tiresome politicians trying to make me feel comfortable by telling how often they are eating the curry in georgetown
10977, 1 ### but then i decided just like governor arnold schwarzenegger i try anyway
10978, 1 ### but she told me mom you don't have to worry about boys because i don't like them
10979, 1 ### so i always teach my kids to respect american ideas but i told my daughter that this is one exception that she is not gay she is just confused by this american problem
10980, 1 ### she said she is in love in love with a nice chinese girl
10982, 0 ### thank you so very much for having me here today
10983, 0 ### not only of course the scientists and all the wonderful giants of the industries but the celebrities
10984, 0 ### and you've all made these advancements happen in such a short time you're all so young
10985, 0 ### you know it's heartening to me
10986, 0 ### congratulations
10988, 0 ### i usually have to just like try to calm down and take a deep breath
10989, 0 ### so anyway what i was trying to say is that i really love ted
10990, 0 ### i like that
10991, 0 ### i am a working mother and i also go to school full time
10992, 0 ### so i think all people we need that but especially i look at people like me you know like i mean latinos we're about to be the majority in like two weeks
10993, 0 ### he always always treated each of us you know equally unbearably during the class
10994, 0 ### and sadly i don't think we'll have time for you to meet everybody i brought but i'm trying to behave myself it's my first time here
10995, 0 ### but when they got older when the time comes for them to start think about getting married that's when we expect them to realize a little bit more their own culture
10996, 1 ### eighteen months later at the age of she arrived in washington with hundreds following her including many congressmen who had gotten in a car and driven out about a mile outside of the city to walk in with her
10997, 0 ### the community the techies said this flaw has to be addressed
10999, 1 ### that's it
11000, 1 ### as our aboriginal mate said you white fellows ought to get out more
11001, 0 ### it works in the places where they live and the work is done to improve their health
11002, 0 ### he got a medical doctor
11004, 1 ### in fact the words wrong number were more popular than the word hello
11005, 1 ### and the second goat says no the book was better
11006, 1 ### and they scrawled on the windshield in a reference to the show's heroine long live
11008, 1 ### all the others have been all those three
11010, 0 ### the americans have even recognized it in an agreement
11011, 0 ### soft power is a concept invented by a harvard academic joseph nye a friend of mine
11012, 0 ### so soft power is something that really emerges partly because of governments but partly despite governments
11013, 0 ### in order to have soft power you have to be connected
11014, 1 ### he had written vague but exciting in pencil in the corner
11015, 0 ### but months later this is how innovation happens months later my boss said i could do it on the side as a sort of a play project kick the tires of a new computer we'd got
11016, 1 ### and in the astronaut business we have a saying which is there is no problem so bad that you can't make it worse
11018, 1 ### and now we use johnson's no more tears which we probably should've been using right from the very beginning
11021, 0 ### you are in the grip of something that is vastly more powerful than yourself
11022, 0 ### and we're alive
11025, 1 ### in the beginning of goodbye art i focused on forced destruction like this image of jimi hendrix made with over matches
11026, 1 ### now when i run into a barrier or i find myself creatively stumped i sometimes still struggle but i continue to show up for the process and try to remind myself of the possibilities like using hundreds of real live worms to make an image using a to tattoo a banana or painting a picture with hamburger grease
11027, 0 ### so to compensate i'd hold the pen tighter and this progressively made the shake worse so i'd hold the pen tighter still
11029, 0 ### this was the first time i'd encountered this idea that embracing a limitation could actually drive creativity
11030, 1 ### sorry about this jeff
11031, 1 ### should've been a dancer
11032, 1 ### don't worry
11033, 1 ### or maybe you're even the woolly mammoth
11034, 1 ### next time you hear someone singing over your shoulder it might be bono
11035, 0 ### and the look on my face is the feeling that i've been searching for ever since
11036, 0 ### music yeah
11038, 0 ### and after years of searching i found a prototype
11041, 1 ### and i'm sure he did that later
11043, 0 ### and he begins to move beyond his self concern into the broader concern for others
11044, 1 ### this last year is this going to matter in a decade or this or this really is this going to matter in or years okay that was kind of cool
11045, 0 ### it's a project by the long now foundation which was founded by including kevin kelly and stewart brand
11046, 1 ### gooseberry owned a patent for the creation and distribution of news releases via email
11047, 1 ### so would you mind giving us your best and final offer my response how about nothing we didn't have high hopes for that outcome
11048, 1 ### and i thought i should patent this
11049, 0 ### now my company deals with news ostensibly and as a result we were not in violation of this patent
11050, 0 ### now i had hoped to team up with some of these larger companies in order to defend against this lawsuit but one they settled out of the case even though and this is important none of these companies infringed on this patent not a one of them
11051, 0 ### their attorney ah yes
11054, 1 ### it looks like a big boring word but it's actually quite exciting because is the only with in it
11055, 1 ### you just have to know where to look and to maybe be a little thin
11056, 0 ### now this species here is so new i'm not even allowed to tell you its name yet but i can tell you it's a new species from mexico and it's probably already extinct
11057, 0 ### and i'm going to spend my one life as an trying to discover and save these humble little blind that can tell us so much about the geology of the planet and the biology of how we see
11058, 1 ### from this you actually learn that retired european families are extremely patient with survey takers
11059, 1 ### excuse me would you mind if i peruse your stock portfolio do you happen to know how much your house is worth do you mind telling me would you happen to have a hallway that's more than meters long if you do would you mind if i timed how long it took you to walk down that hallway would you mind squeezing as hard as you can in your dominant hand this device so i can measure your grip strength how about blowing into this tube so i can measure your lung capacity the survey takes over a day
11060, 0 ### let's start by thinking about the member countries of the or the organization of economic cooperation and development
11062, 1 ### as an irishman he hated the english so much he didn't have much emotion for anyone else
11064, 1 ### think how different america would be if every american knew that this is the fifth time western armies have gone to afghanistan to put its house in order and if they had some idea of exactly what had happened on those four previous occasions
11065, 0 ### now this dramatic change was drawn to my attention through massive i
11070, 1 ### so all we have is this record
11071, 1 ### in fact they funded it for that very reason
11072, 1 ### and then for a real beginner you would go down even further and elaborate more say open the oven wait for the light to go out open the door don't leave it open too long put the penguin in and shut the door
11073, 1 ### i suspect that some of you might not even understand that language
11074, 1 ### it's absolutely irrelevant and i get nothing for it
11075, 1 ### there is no reason for a child to read and write except blind faith and that it's going to help you
11077, 0 ### people have this belief and i share most of it that we will be using the tv screens or their equivalents for electronic books of the future
11079, 0 ### and my favorite example is always fingers
11081, 0 ### and it's pressure sensitive to the forces both in the plane of the screen x y and z at least in one direction we couldn't figure out how to come in the other direction
11082, 0 ### we are so used to doing monologues
11083, 0 ### one is that this book knows about itself
11084, 0 ### there are all sorts of techniques you will use and again this is a different kind of branching
11085, 0 ### when i find a chapter that i want to see i just touch the text and the system will format pages for me to read
11086, 1 ### it's not so much as so little has to do with what everything is
11088, 1 ### i know it because people come up to me like colleagues and say chris you have a strange career
11089, 1 ### i said i have no idea
11090, 1 ### and then you might get something
11091, 0 ### i'm going to tell you about how i learned something about life
11093, 0 ### except if you think that life is also defined by things that die you're not in luck with this thing because that's actually a very strange organism
11096, 1 ### now i still have my struggles particularly with the anxiety but i'm able to manage it through daily mediation yoga and a relatively healthy diet
11099, 0 ### i was standing on their shoulders
11100, 1 ### i haven't come to the best part
11101, 0 ### there are a lot of stories about why we did this
11102, 1 ### his name is nostradamus although here the sun have made him look a little bit like sean connery
11103, 1 ### that would mean that i was a and you were an idiot for letting me get away with it
11104, 1 ### complications is a medical euphemism for pneumonia and death
11105, 0 ### and in fact we know that that's true because several different groups of research scientists tried to replicate the findings of this study and when they submitted it to the exact same journal the journal said no we're not interested in publishing replication
11106, 0 ### and they say in their discussion that this is very likely because freaks get published
11109, 1 ### sounds like fast food doesn't it
11111, 1 ### those have to pay tuition fees know
11112, 1 ### okay it's not obvious to be honest
11113, 1 ### this is what we are using
11114, 1 ### at least in my case they are not listened to
11115, 0 ### so everyone of you turns to their neighbor please
11116, 0 ### so this ingenuity of our ancestors to invent this most marvelous technology
11119, 0 ### you need proteins for muscles recovery
11120, 0 ### and something which maybe you don't like but you are so hungry that you really will be satisfied to eat
11121, 0 ### and within this structure you see these two pinkish layers which are actually the muscle
11122, 1 ### too many buildings that you see outside that are so banal tell you a story but the story is very short which says we have no story to tell you
11123, 0 ### we can think them out
11124, 1 ### the remnant whale populations were saved by technological innovators and profit maximizing capitalists
11125, 1 ### this is not very gratifying after more than a century of devoted engineering effort
11127, 1 ### we are the saudi arabia of barrels
11131, 0 ### on the competitiveness front we all know that toyota has more market cap than the big three put together
11132, 0 ### the point here is these cars are going to be made super efficient
11133, 0 ### and one of the worst of these is what it does to our standing in the world if other countries think that everything we do is about oil if we have to treat countries that have oil differently than countries that don't have oil
11136, 1 ### it's because the elevator is missing some important instrumentation like the buttons
11137, 1 ### we'll actually part the water to pull money out of the air because it's a bright future if you're an algorithm
11138, 0 ### the photo was made when we were deep in the valley over there
11139, 0 ### but i think the point is that this is metaphor with teeth and it's with those teeth that i want to propose today that we rethink a little bit about the role of contemporary math not just financial math but math in general
11142, 1 ### i don't think they thought i'd grow up to sell insurance
11143, 0 ### on the way back to the ministry in the car she turned around to me and said rose you've always been interested in finance
11144, 1 ### to tell a four kid to wait minutes for something that they like is equivalent to telling us we'll bring you coffee in two hours
11145, 1 ### some lasted minutes
11146, 1 ### and let me show you what happened
11147, 1 ### this little girl was interesting she ate the inside of the marshmallow
11149, 0 ### that child already at four understood the most important principle for success which is the ability to delay gratification
11150, 0 ### they were doing wonderful
11151, 0 ### they had bad grades
11152, 0 ### that person ate the marshmallow
11155, 1 ### the reality is that this issue is much too important to be left to politicians and to the united nations
11158, 0 ### indeed when ireland first joined the european union in there were parts of the country that were considered developing including my own beloved native county county mayo
11160, 0 ### i don't remember making a single speech on climate change
11165, 1 ### because he's an open mouth sleeper he says he has to floss more to help prevent gum disease and so i asked him how often he and he said every other day
11166, 1 ### bill is an auditor and we talked the entire three minutes about auditing
11167, 1 ### i think he was drunk
11169, 0 ### not long after she left her job to study photography in maine and while she was there she ended up meeting the director of photography at the new york times magazine and was actually offered a job
11173, 0 ### he was there alone drinking and she was with friends
11174, 0 ### at the end of the day after we left sun city i told alec that i didn't actually think that the stories of how these couples met were all that interesting
11177, 1 ### i know some of you are working on this
11179, 0 ### now the american health care system has more than its fair share of dysfunction to match its brilliance to be sure
11181, 0 ### it's a key distinction
11184, 0 ### it's probably impossible
11186, 1 ### and as it turned out these guys really taught me a thing or two about blending in with the locals
11187, 0 ### and this happens every two weeks
11188, 1 ### if you look at their patent carefully especially if you have any engineering background or talent you may decide that you see one or two points where the design is not perfectly adequate
11189, 1 ### now i hope you will agree with me that these things i've just described to you each of them deserves some kind of prize
11190, 1 ### a trillion bill from zimbabwe
11192, 1 ### they stopped using oxygen pretty quickly

11231, 0 ### alt facts have that quality
11233, 0 ### we have got to break out of these digital divides because as our technology advances the consequences of our tribalism become more dangerous
11235, 0 ### keep in mind conversations stop violence conversations start countries they build bridges and when the chips are down conversations are the last tools that humans use before they pick up their guns
11237, 0 ### this made them want to leave the safety of their laptops and meet us in person to have real conversations with real people in real life
11238, 0 ### this is a collective and conscious evolution

11242, 1 ### the political aspects of mobile phones can't be ignored either from text message swarms in korea helping to bring down a government to the project in the keeping tabs on politicians who try to avoid the press
11243, 0 ### our emphasis on solutions is quite intentional
11244, 0 ### as a born gen x er hurtling all too quickly to my fortieth birthday i'm naturally inclined to pessimism

11247, 1 ### and the incredible thing about hyena shit is it makes great chalk
11248, 1 ### when i started talking to richard about what i was going to speak about i had recently come back from jordan where i had an amazing experience with a camel
11249, 1 ### about every steps they lean back and try to take a chunk out of your leg
11250, 1 ### it is a pound creature who is in rut
11251, 1 ### and if richard thought i was getting in the ring with that camel someone was smoking bedouin high grade
11252, 0 ### but over the years the blackboards were fine but they ran out of chalk
11253, 0 ### you can just imagine this expanse is an ocean of sand degrees one water bottle
11254, 0 ### and eventually our worst nightmare happened they flooded the engine
11255, 0 ### we got out and walked and sure enough about half a mile we came over the crest of this hill and there was a huge gathering of bedouin with their camels
11256, 0 ### so as we talked richard and i i said you know maybe i should bring a camel
11257, 0 ### richard said i want you to get up close and personal with this camel

11266, 1 ### what we have here is a painting of the great poet burns and it's just a normal image but if we now switch inputs over to the phone running our technology you can see effectively what seeing on the screen and when she points at this image something magical happens
11269, 1 ### they're not very animated
11270, 0 ### all the processing to do that was actually done on the device itself
11272, 0 ### in the last years it's really changed the way that we live and work and the way that we see the world and what's great is we sort of think this is the next paradigm shift because now we can literally take the content that we share we discover and that we enjoy and make it a part of the world around us
11274, 1 ### in a nutshell it's a choice between big brother watching you and you watching big brother
11275, 1 ### and on there are four main categories number one smoking cigarettes number two smoking marijuana number three smoking ribs and number four smoking hot women

11309, 0 ### and thank you chris for having us
11310, 1 ### i like to call this blind championing of technology trickle down to borrow a phrase
11312, 1 ### we call it the section fiasco the section fiasco a suspicious piece of law and i'm going to say it like it is a suspicious piece of law was passed at a suspicious time to free some suspects
11314, 1 ### not as popular as some of the other people but there you go
11315, 0 ### we have to have the courage to admit that to start changing how we deal with it
11316, 0 ### it is an economic crime because we're involving the looting of taxpayers' money
11317, 0 ### it's a piece of public mischief
11318, 1 ### they gave it back to the wise old woman
11319, 1 ### and as the saying goes when angry you will make the best speech you will ever regret

11323, 0 ### brotherly tempers started to get strained
11324, 0 ### we're all one family
11325, 0 ### as i've spent the last better part of three decades almost four traveling the world trying to work getting involved in conflicts ranging from yugoslavia to the middle east to chechnya to venezuela some of the most difficult conflicts on the face of the planet i've been asking myself that question
11328, 1 ### so what's going on where's the brain trust that's in error here well there really is no brain trust
11329, 0 ### many of the people involved have special interests or short term interests that get them not thinking about what the implications of the trends are
11331, 1 ### the mothers aren't quite convinced
11332, 1 ### the yellow box was called the administration complex
11333, 0 ### cynthia and i were there
11334, 0 ### the desks are not square
11336, 1 ### but what i keep thinking is that we're in a zombie apocalypse movie
11338, 1 ### maybe instead it's a buddy cop movie
11341, 0 ### and i think that most alarming of all of it is seeing this rising animosity on both sides
11342, 0 ### not that
11346, 1 ### because although protests can be a great way to show that people want change on their own they don't actually create change at least change that is fundamental
11348, 1 ### at one point the organizers delivered hundreds of eggs to various government buildings with a message if you don't have the the balls to stop corrupt candidates from running for office you can borrow ours
11349, 1 ### you can see here that the police are confused about what to do with them
11350, 1 ### one pig was even wearing a hat a hat that people recognized
11351, 0 ### which means that no matter how destructive and terrible violence is if people see it as their only choice they will use it
11353, 0 ### my colleague and mentor gene sharp has identified methods of nonviolent action
11354, 0 ### the technique of war has been developed over thousands of years with massive resources and some of our best minds dedicated to understanding and improving how it works
11355, 0 ### parents simply refused to send them
11356, 1 ### this is a very low bar
11357, 1 ### now sometimes in animation females are so thin that their waist size approximates the circumference of their upper arm
11358, 1 ### we like to say that these gals have no room for a womb or any other internal organ
11361, 1 ### heaven forbid
11362, 0 ### storytelling is so important
11363, 0 ### my team is tired
11364, 0 ### less than a third there's been no change from to and if you compare our results to a small sample of films from to there's been no change in over a half of a century
11367, 0 ### they perceive the traits of leadership to be masculine in nature
11370, 0 ### and the global vote does exactly what it says on the tin
11377, 0 ### i'm not done yet
11378, 1 ### and there is the chief in all his regal finery with a laptop computer
11379, 1 ### so that when louis leakey my mentor heard this news he said ah we must now redefine redefine or accept chimpanzees as humans
11381, 0 ### and so coming directly from there to here
11384, 1 ### i'm going to show you some stuff that not only has not been declassified but has now been reclassified
11385, 1 ### if all goes well next year i'll be back and i'll have a lot more to show you and if all doesn't go well i'll be in jail like wen ho lee
11386, 1 ### my father was not going to take his children that was one of the reasons we sort of had a falling out for a few years
11387, 1 ### so these are three pound charges of c4 that's about times what the guy had in his shoes
11388, 1 ### if you saw the this is what it would feel like in the passenger compartment that's acceleration profile
11389, 1 ### well here we have a little problem the radiation doses at the crew station per shot
11390, 1 ### this is what happens to the people in miami who are looking up
11392, 0 ### it would take two or three thousand bombs
11394, 0 ### these are five yield bombs about the size of small volkswagens it would take to get into orbit
11395, 0 ### the people who supported it were the air force which meant that it was all secret
11396, 0 ### it's quite dangerous but i believe it's better to have dangerous things in the open than think you're going to keep them secret
11397, 0 ### so all my life i have wanted to find this stuff out and spent the last four years tracking these old guys down
11398, 0 ### this is crew compartment
11399, 0 ### the sort of artist conceptions
11400, 1 ### and i can remember actually when i got the phone call to congratulate us to say the movie was a go i actually threw up
11401, 1 ### and of course the first step is admit you've got a problem
11402, 1 ### right so effectively we ended up with a database of everything brad pitt's face is capable of doing
11404, 0 ### there's nothing wrong with old age
11405, 0 ### i felt pretty good considering
11406, 1 ### instead i ended up stoning my neighbors' cars
11407, 0 ### but that changed when i was
11408, 1 ### my mother and i can be competitive but i was really not trying to compete with her on this one
11409, 1 ### so i did get my treatment at the cancer center where i worked which was amazingly convenient and i had chemotherapy and a mastectomy and a saline implant put in and so before i say another word let me just say right now this is the fake one
11414, 0 ### that was probably our first mistake
11415, 0 ### we have to decide what it means
11420, 1 ### that's him pressing my buttons back there which he does all the time
11426, 1 ### but i'll tell you later if you want to know
11429, 1 ### now don't get me wrong we need money
11433, 0 ### and we all pay dearly for solid waste costs health problems associated with pollution and more the cost of imprisoning our young black and latino men who possess untold amounts of untapped potential
11434, 0 ### yeah i'm a poor black child from the ghetto
11435, 0 ### and as others like him pursued their own version of the american dream white flight became common in the south bronx and in many cities around the country
11436, 0 ### the south bronx which lies in between did not stand a chance
11439, 0 ### they provide opportunities to be more physically active as well as local economic development
11443, 1 ### but growing up i saw my parents both religiously devout and spiritual people pray and praise god for their blessings namely me of course but among others
11447, 0 ### so at the school of international affairs we go very heavy on the debate and rule number one is do your research so that's what i did and it surprised me how easy it was to find women in my faith who were leaders who were innovative who were strong politically economically even militarily
11448, 1 ### you'd actually bump your head
11450, 1 ### see architects really are relationship builders
11451, 0 ### and besides are highly specific urban habitats with their own insects plants and animals and even their own weather
11453, 0 ### and everybody wanted the work of social justice to be visible to the outside world
11454, 1 ### some of you look a little more enthusiastic than others at this prospect
11455, 1 ### it doesn't happen you will have noticed if your grandmother had a hip replacement she didn't come out as a junkie
11457, 1 ### before these talks began you guys know this we were told we weren't allowed to have our on and i have to say a lot of you looked an awful lot like addicts who were told their dealer was going to be unavailable for the next couple of hours
11459, 0 ### right that's what i thought
11460, 0 ### you get a rat and you put it in a cage and you give it two water bottles one is just water and the other is water laced with either heroin or cocaine
11461, 0 ### let's try something different
11463, 1 ### and all around the world this is how products are being distributed so for instance in one street market on rua de maro in so paulo brazil you can buy fake designer glasses
11464, 1 ### you can buy designer underwear that isn't really manufactured by a designer and even pirated evangelical
11465, 1 ### the sneaker manufacturer told me that if they find that are being pirated or adidas are being pirated and their sneakers aren't being pirated they know they've done something wrong
11467, 0 ### that's his little depot behind him and he earns twice the nigerian minimum wage
11468, 0 ### i think it's really important to understand that something like this is totally open
11469, 0 ### but governments hate the economy and that's why i took this picture in and this is the same market in and i think when the organizers of this conference were talking about radical openness they didn't mean that the streets should be open and the people should be gone
11473, 1 ### amy i think this means you're a unicorn
11476, 1 ### and we know that's a measurement error because it's messing up my data
11477, 1 ### during the first year of medical training as you read through a list of all the symptoms and diseases suddenly you realize you have all of them
11482, 0 ### i talked to a new england boarding school probably the most prestigious one and they said we already know that
11483, 0 ### the absence of disease is not health
11484, 0 ### every time your brain has a success you just changed the goalpost of what success looked like
11487, 0 ### about one positive experience you've had over the past hours allows your brain to relive it
11488, 1 ### i've guessed you've already noticed this by now
11489, 1 ### i don't think so
11490, 1 ### and in the first year i had to fire half of the men
11491, 1 ### and he ended up writing about a story that even surprised me hip hop that there are young yemeni men who express themselves through dancing and
11492, 1 ### i'm just not in touch
11493, 0 ### the other picture is the popularity of the real need for change
11494, 0 ### and they were excluded from decision making and now they are in the forefront of the news raising the flag
11495, 0 ### and finally lots of people are saying that yemen's revolution is going to break the country
11496, 0 ### so let's talk about the personal story for a moment
11497, 0 ### he would say we are equal
11498, 1 ### god damn it
11499, 1 ### i think that's the cia asking what the code is for a ted membership
11500, 1 ### and we then got a letter just this week from the company who wrote it wanting to track down the source saying hey we want to track down the source
11505, 0 ### so i went there in and we managed to get hold of this just prior to the election the national election december
11506, 0 ### and it ran for nights straight on kenyan tv shifted the vote by percent according to a kenyan intelligence report which changed the result of the election
11508, 1 ### i am an engineering professor and for the past years i've been teaching crap
11510, 1 ### i say it doesn't matter if you're a washer or a wiper a sitter or a squatter the human user interface should be clean and easy to use because after all taking a dump should be pleasurable
11511, 0 ### for them there's no modern toilet
11513, 0 ### it's a dirty and dangerous business
11514, 1 ### i was doing some shopping before
11515, 1 ### big miscommunication
11516, 1 ### if i did it slowly it'd be on your shoulder
11519, 1 ### so we'd love to give you this lovely watch as a gift
11522, 0 ### let's take that a step further with a game of trust
11524, 0 ### for me i like to think of it very simple like a surveillance system
11525, 0 ### if you don't attend to something you can't be aware of it
11527, 0 ### this sounds like a good theory but i could talk for a long time tell you lots of things and a portion of them may be true but i think it's better if i tried to show that to you here live
11528, 1 ### so some of the stuff is a little dense
11529, 0 ### and they've told us that this brain is an incredibly complicated circuit made out of hundreds of billions of cells called neurons
11530, 1 ### you name it i bred it and i sold them to pet shops
11533, 0 ### it's based on an approach called string theory and that's where the idea of the will come into the story
11534, 1 ### australians we don't mind a bit of a drink sometimes to excess leading to embarrassing social situations
11536, 1 ### and there was that same awkward silence from most of my classmates until sitting next to me one of my friends one of the cool kids in class steven leaned across and punched me really hard in the head
11537, 1 ### the proof of that is a great party trick that admittedly only works at certain parties
11539, 1 ### he was so respected they put him on european currency back when that was a compliment
11540, 1 ### word up l dog
11542, 1 ### my arts degree was the best nine and a half years of my life
11544, 1 ### this is all seven harry potter novels because she did tend to on a bit near the end
11547, 0 ### i explained it to all my friends
11548, 0 ### and today i want to show you one of those musical notes a number so beautiful so massive i think it will blow your mind
11551, 0 ### we didn't know for almost years until frank nelson cole came along
11552, 0 ### these are the largest prime numbers we knew decade by decade each one dwarfing the one before as computers took over and our power to calculate just grew and grew
11554, 0 ### don't forget to subtract the one
11555, 0 ### large prime numbers are a great way of testing the speed and accuracy of computer chips
11556, 0 ### we've heard a lot about what they can and can't do
11558, 1 ### and that's architecture
11559, 1 ### it's about concrete
11560, 1 ### dwarves became columns
11561, 1 ### but it's the it's cool
11563, 1 ### this is ohio
11564, 1 ### seattle chicago new york cleveland springfield
11565, 1 ### it means that a parking garage in miami beach florida can also be a place for sports and for yoga and you can even get married there late at night
11566, 0 ### and in between my bedroom and the bathroom was a balcony that overlooked the family room
11567, 0 ### that makes us a little bit gullible and very very predictable
11568, 0 ### we used it in the century to build art museums
11569, 0 ### this is a nice building
11571, 0 ### we add neon and we add pastels and we use new materials
11572, 0 ### and then something amazing happened
11573, 0 ### so every mayor knew that if they had these forms they had culture and tourism
11574, 1 ### it was during week two that our neighbor next door opened up our door and threw a pizza across the kitchen floor saying i think you people might need food in there
11575, 1 ### it was interesting
11577, 0 ### and one night i found myself having a beer with pete and pete was looking at me and he just said you know mom i don't know selling group insurance is just not my passion
11578, 1 ### once you understand this trait you can understand why anybody would eat at applebee's but not anybody that you know
11579, 1 ### what kinds of people would join a global community welcoming people from every discipline and culture who seek a deeper understanding of the world and who hope to turn that understanding into a better future for us all this is from some guy named ted
11580, 1 ### when the liberal team loses as it did in and as it almost did in we comfort ourselves
11581, 1 ### we think they must be blinded by religion or by simple stupidity
11582, 1 ### and this tribal psychology is so deeply pleasurable that even when we don't have tribes we go ahead and make them because it's fun
11583, 1 ### suppose you learn that this particular breed is independent minded and relates to its owner as a friend and an equal well if you are a liberal you say hey that's great because liberals like to say fetch please
11585, 1 ### some of you might recognize this as the
11587, 0 ### please raise your hand if you'd say you're libertarian
11588, 0 ### you're all high in openness to experience and besides it looks like it might even taste good and you're all
11589, 0 ### the best definition of i've ever seen this just clarifies so many things for me is from the brain scientist gary marcus
11591, 0 ### there's actually ambiguous evidence as to whether you find reciprocity in other animals but the evidence for people could not be clearer
11594, 1 ### so instead we're going to do years in seconds or less
11597, 1 ### holy shit
11599, 1 ### and after all that they finally think you're ready for a ted talk
11601, 1 ### let me put it this way when i came back from the war she showed me the letters that i had written her from overseas and they were absolute love letters
11606, 0 ### that night newspapers were all over the house my father was with his hat in front of his face to a detective
11607, 0 ### oh my grandfather
11609, 0 ### and i mean i stole arthur marshall's grandfather and made him my own
11610, 0 ### my favorite role in life
11614, 1 ### you can do that quite fast
11616, 1 ### they merged with aol and in just four years managed to shed about billion dollars of market capitalization showing that they'd actually mastered the art of applying moore's law of successive miniaturization to their balance sheet
11618, 0 ### to get a sense of this and it's been a theme we've talked about all week i recently talked to a bunch of
11619, 0 ### girl i think we the reasons one of the reasons we put computer before tv is because nowadays like we have tv shows on the computer
11620, 1 ### here
11622, 1 ### million miles above this stage
11623, 1 ### so there are many possibilities
11624, 0 ### we all of us are what happens when a primordial mixture of hydrogen and helium evolves for so long that it begins to ask where it came from
11625, 0 ### now we can use the tools of the century to try and observe what is rather than ask what should be believed
11628, 1 ### my great grew up quite close to the edge of the niger river
11631, 0 ### i regretted my purchase
11634, 1 ### you're born you peak at midlife and decline into
11635, 1 ### some of the studies even say we're happier
11636, 1 ### picasso once said it takes a long time to become young
11637, 1 ### now let me say something about the staircase which may seem like an odd metaphor for seniors given the fact that many seniors are challenged by stairs
11640, 0 ### this upward ascension can happen even in the face of extreme physical challenges
11642, 0 ### perhaps our parents suffered from depression
11644, 1 ### and i've got here a little micrograms of white powder which i try not to let the security people see at airports
11645, 1 ### so if anyone would like a hundred million copies of my business card i have plenty for everyone in the room and in fact everyone in the world and it's right here
11646, 1 ### in fact their life depended on doing the job
11648, 0 ### this happens to be a slide of some analysis that we were doing about the power of risc microprocessors versus the power of local area networks
11649, 0 ### if you could bring up the lights higher because i'm just going to use a piece of paper here
11651, 0 ### that's about all it can do
11652, 1 ### but here's the problem to catch cat fleas is difficult
11654, 1 ### now if you ever made a essentially the same thing
11655, 0 ### two hundred years is not a lot of time while nature had three billion years to perfect some of the most amazing materials that we wish we had in our possession
11656, 0 ### and this cellulose is so strong on a weight basis it's about times stronger than steel
11657, 0 ### but no commercial source
11658, 1 ### he said and it's not me because i like you people
11659, 1 ### it was another great location
11661, 1 ### they're almost there but not quite
11663, 0 ### he said so here is a list of people that you can call and then they will then allow you to select the apartment that you want
11664, 0 ### just come on down select the apartment that you want
11665, 0 ### i was just coming down to make my selection
11666, 0 ### so as a result of that and feeling rejected i went back to the base and i talked to the squadron commander
11667, 0 ### why don't you let your family stay home because you do know that you get a leave
11668, 1 ### so war is an even less efficient way so i tend to prefer progressive taxation but of course history history will invent its own best ways and it will probably involve a combination of all of these
11669, 0 ### we know a little bit more today than we used to know but we still know too little and certainly there are many different processes economic social political that need to be studied more
11671, 1 ### i'll have that surgery
11672, 0 ### so that's where this field comes in that we call the field of medicine
11673, 0 ### but it's actually not a new field
11674, 1 ### now today less than one tenth of one percent of the world's population are scientists and engineers
11678, 0 ### today a container ship can carry tons it can be manned with a smaller crew and unloaded faster than ever before
11684, 1 ### but people think it's this string of and and rainbows when in reality it looks more something like this
11685, 1 ### and if you're in the ecuadorian you're going to eat a large rodent called a
11686, 1 ### and so we've treated them as these second class ecosystems because they have very little monetary value and of course they're known to harbor alligators and snakes which i'll admit these aren't the most cuddly of ambassadors
11690, 0 ### despite all these years that have passed i still see the world through the eyes of a child and i try to incorporate that sense of wonderment and that sense of curiosity into my photography as often as i can
11692, 0 ### they nest and they mate and they breed in these old growth swamps in these flooded forests
11693, 0 ### now despite all this rich life that abounds in these swamps they still have a bad name
11694, 1 ### and while pregnant i had never been asked how i was feeling so much in all my life
11695, 0 ### before polly no one had ever told me that she'd had an abortion
11696, 1 ### and we probably need well we probably need a cowboy to be quite honest
11697, 1 ### c'mon
11698, 0 ### it's like the land and the king i
11699, 0 ### but in the quarter century since then we've seen all of the fundamental supporting technologies go berserk
11704, 1 ### and i realized then i had to go to design school
11706, 1 ### and then i saw this quote advertising is the price companies pay for being
11707, 1 ### the bottles connect together and you can create different shapes different forms
11709, 1 ### it was hard
11710, 1 ### and a month and a half later i come back to switzerland and there he is playing with his own version
11711, 1 ### i'm going to finish with one last project and this is a little bit more of adult play
11712, 1 ### and here's the public service announcement for this project
11715, 0 ### and then there was another influence
11718, 0 ### it allows the person to switch and to mix these two
11719, 0 ### so jawbone is a project that you're familiar with and it has a humanistic technology
11720, 0 ### but how we work on jawbone is really unique
11721, 0 ### and it's what i call being design driven
11722, 0 ### so in a way the different structure is that we're partners it's a partnership
11724, 0 ### but when nicholas and he has spoken about this project a lot he's the founder of came to us about two and a half years ago there were some clear ideas
11725, 0 ### they fought the suppliers they fought the manufacturers
11726, 1 ### it worked out
11730, 1 ### now i have a great affinity for charles babbage because his hair is always completely unkempt like this in every single picture
11731, 1 ### i really miss that era you know where you could go around for a soiree and see a mechanical computer get demonstrated to you
11732, 1 ### i'm going to work on this one
11733, 1 ### he did this until sir robert peel then prime minister basically kicked him out of number downing street and kicking him out in those days that meant saying i bid you good day sir
11736, 1 ### that'll calm her down
11738, 1 ### in fact it was capable of doing everything we do today with computers only really slowly
11740, 1 ### i probably smell it operating
11741, 0 ### and i'm going to take you through the architecture of the machine that's why it's computer architecture and tell you about this machine which is a computer
11742, 0 ### the problem with using binary is that the machine would have been so tall it would have been ridiculous
11743, 0 ### completely mechanical
11744, 0 ### it could do more
11745, 0 ### all this cog wheel mechanism here is doing is what a computer does but of course you need to program this thing and of course babbage used the technology of the day and the technology that would reappear in the and which is punch cards
11746, 0 ### now he needed accessories
11749, 0 ### both of these guys were coming from a mathematical perspective but turing told us something very important
11750, 0 ### one was the scanning of babbage's archive
11751, 0 ### so give me five years
11752, 1 ### and it got big enough to the point where there was a float last year at the macy's thanksgiving day parade and rick astley pops out and millions of people on television
11753, 1 ### no exceptions
11754, 1 ### and so you know percent approval rating ain't so bad
11755, 1 ### also the game
11756, 1 ### they are still protesting
11757, 1 ### and the thing is i didn't make it into that presentation because i can't read to you anything that they said more or less
11759, 1 ### but my parents i think part of why they kind of are able to appreciate it is because they don't understand it
11760, 1 ### they still didn't know what to think of that though
11761, 0 ### tom green yeah
11762, 0 ### and so what i did is i took it i translated it into english and i stuck it up for my friends to use
11763, 0 ### and that's led to this discussion that's completely raw completely unfiltered
11764, 0 ### they matched they found his
11765, 0 ### they're endangered because we're moving towards social networking
11766, 0 ### got a couple questions for you
11767, 0 ### but anonymity basically allows people to say anything all the rules gone
11768, 0 ### and saying whatever you like i think is powerful
11770, 1 ### here just for historical authenticity is a picture of me in that year
11771, 1 ### i mean she knows i'm not a dog
11772, 1 ### one was growing out the back and it attached to the muscle which is a big muscle in the back that i'd never heard of but all of a sudden i cared about it
11773, 1 ### before i met her i went through some search results
11774, 1 ### and it goes like this
11776, 0 ### i had been under the name patient dave and when i discovered this i just renamed myself e patient dave
11777, 0 ### this is about letting patients play a more active role in helping health care in fixing health care
11778, 0 ### it talked about how to build your own house how to grow your own food all kinds of things
11779, 0 ### obviously at this stage of life he was in a somewhat more dignified form than he was back then
11780, 0 ### i had the blue partition carpet on the walls
11782, 1 ### i had just gone through a breakup
11783, 1 ### so what if we could start off by going into the brain and just finding a single memory to begin with could we jump start that memory back to life maybe even play with the contents of that memory all that said there is one person in the entire world right now that i really hope is not watching this talk
11786, 1 ### we are trying to shoot lasers into the brain
11787, 1 ### while watching this steve and i are as shocked as the mouse itself
11788, 1 ### now i happen to completely agree with the optimism of this first quote because on a scale of zero to morgan freeman's voice it happens to be one of the most evocative accolades that i've heard come our way
11789, 0 ### so yeah this task does seem to be daunting
11790, 0 ### sr so the same way that building lights at night let you know that somebody's probably working there at any given moment in a very real sense there are biological sensors within a cell that are turned on only when that cell was just working
11791, 0 ### you're actually looking at the cross section of a memory right now
11793, 0 ### that's true
11794, 0 ### what we can do is we can take our mice and then we can put them in a box that looks exactly like this box here and then we can give them a very mild foot shock so that they form a fear memory of this box
11797, 1 ### fish chills
11798, 0 ### in the last years global meat consumption has more than quadrupled from million tons to million tons
11799, 0 ### currently our ocean serves as the main source of animal protein
11802, 1 ### if you looked in the book you saw this
11803, 1 ### which i really was appalled by
11804, 1 ### and because i wanted to impress you all with slides since i saw the great presentations yesterday with graphs i made a graph that moves and i talk about the makeup of me
11805, 1 ### this is my grandmother and this is where i get this mouth
11806, 1 ### i am not that caring
11807, 1 ### you can laugh this is ok
11809, 1 ### this is my husband who is very hot he won an award for being hot
11810, 1 ### because the joke in this is that this person is not a tyrant this person is so loving and so sweet that he lets me dress him up and post pictures of him to my
11811, 1 ### and then i got people saying leave him
11813, 1 ### i put the bad pictures up too because there are bad pictures
11815, 0 ### you have my friend who has a on personal recorders
11816, 0 ### and i said i'm going to win the south by southwest award
11818, 0 ### but anyways it's these sorts of personal stories you know you read the about politics or about media and gossip and all these things
11819, 0 ### one story is about this baby and his name is odin
11821, 0 ### that's not a huge amount of people reading but people matter
11822, 0 ### it's this record of who you are your persona
11823, 0 ### but to see something like the computer is amazing because software is simple
11824, 0 ### but this is basically the extent of the family that i know in terms of my direct line
11825, 0 ### this is all i have a couple of facts about somebody
11826, 0 ### this is the only picture i have
11831, 1 ### i teach signal processing and my challenge was to show that this math wow about half of you have already fallen asleep just looking at the equation
11836, 0 ### in fact a lot of this use coming from united states schools because anyone who's involved in a school scale back the first thing that's cut is the music curriculum
11838, 1 ### now this one's the tomato
11839, 0 ### bees get all of the protein they need in their diet from pollen and all of the carbohydrates they need from nectar
11840, 1 ### i'll admit it wasn't exactly the smartest of starts but you've got to start somewhere
11841, 1 ### diver uh oh
11842, 1 ### when you start talking like donald duck there's no situation in the world that can seem tense
11844, 1 ### this one you can see how ugly it is
11845, 1 ### so you can't live your life in fear
11846, 0 ### it turns out that particular one was the first of its kind ever taken alive
11847, 0 ### i made a really stupid kind of mistake that most old males do when they think they're immortal and i got a bad case of the bends and was paralyzed and had to be flown back for treatment
11848, 0 ### but this is really just the tip of the iceberg
11850, 0 ### during that year i spent a lot of time learning about the physics and physiology of diving and how to overcome these limitations
11851, 0 ### the oxygen is bound by metabolism we use it for energy
11852, 1 ### there were like people there
11853, 1 ### next your non essential systems start to shut down like digestion
11854, 1 ### your pupils dilate your muscles contract your sense basically your whole body is trigger happy
11856, 0 ### but after a couple of years just writing songs wasn't enough
11857, 0 ### but that was my first real experience as a solo singer songwriter
11858, 0 ### but i'm the one living with me and i know how i get
11859, 0 ### but if i belt one note out clearly you'll know i'm recovering slowly but surely
11860, 1 ### so you go to the literature
11861, 1 ### maybe we could give it to our curator and see if he'd be brave enough to touch the cockroach
11862, 1 ### do we really understand that principle of tuning the answer is yes this is slowed down and the crab just zooms across that simulated debris
11863, 0 ### of course in the challenge there is a prize
11864, 0 ### as you see this clip look for principles and also think about experiments that you might design in order to understand how a foot works
11865, 0 ### it's a design inspired by nature but it's not a copy of any specific foot you just looked at but it's a synthesis of the secrets of many many feet
11866, 1 ### he the wire we have no data
11867, 0 ### now there are around a thousand trucks and buses and cars there
11868, 1 ### one gets such wholesale returns of conjecture out of such a trifling investment in fact
11869, 1 ### it doesn't get better than that
11870, 1 ### told you
11871, 1 ### you can go ahead and play
11872, 1 ### you can go ahead and play
11874, 0 ### because it turns out that the fascinating thing about science is also a fascinating thing about children which to put a gentler spin on mark twain is precisely their ability to draw rich abstract inferences rapidly and accurately from sparse noisy data
11875, 0 ### we poll a tiny fraction of the electorate and we predict the outcome of national elections
11876, 0 ### and they develop expectations about ducks and balls that they're going to extend to rubber ducks and balls for the rest of their lives
11878, 0 ### that is not plausibly randomly sampled evidence
11879, 0 ### that's not an improbable sample
11881, 1 ### and then we have a chicken
11883, 1 ### there's no reason for me to make this talk more depressing than it needs to be
11884, 1 ### add some lsd and some questionable wardrobe choices and the whole world could be like burning man
11885, 1 ### this is the silicon valley version of don't worry your pretty little head about it
11886, 1 ### now this may in fact be the safest and only prudent path forward but usually one's safety concerns about a technology have to be pretty much worked out before you stick it inside your head
11887, 0 ### and in fact i think it's very difficult to see how they won't destroy us or inspire us to destroy ourselves
11889, 0 ### and then we risk what the mathematician good called an intelligence explosion that the process could get away from us
11890, 0 ### we don't go out of our way to harm them
11891, 0 ### but then you must find something wrong with one of the following assumptions
11892, 0 ### right i mean there's just atoms in here and as long as we continue to build systems of atoms that display more and more intelligent behavior we will eventually unless we are interrupted we will eventually build general intelligence into our machines
11895, 1 ### so this is my image of the city of the future
11897, 1 ### you just spin and go directly in
11901, 1 ### i think you have to build dumb homes and put smart stuff in it
11902, 1 ### we think this can all be standardized and then people can personalize the stuff that goes into that wall and like the car we can integrate all kinds of sensing to be aware of human activity so if there's a baby or a puppy in the way you won't have a problem
11904, 0 ### learning took place in schools
11906, 0 ### that means building the equivalent of the entire built infrastructure of the us in years
11909, 0 ### can be concentrated there
11911, 0 ### they took the elevated highway they got rid of it they reclaimed the street the river down below below the street and you can go from one end of seoul to the other without crossing a pathway for cars
11912, 1 ### it might be american vernacular for nihilism
11913, 1 ### white once wrote of commas in the new yorker they fall with the precision of knives outlining a body
11915, 1 ### in this case those commas are well placed except that there should not be one between maniac and on
11916, 1 ### no
11919, 0 ### our business is in the details
11920, 0 ### but you see that hyphen in teen age and that over and you know you're reading the new yorker
11923, 0 ### sandy's story was about the return to the bronx of supreme court justice sonia sotomayor
11924, 0 ### this like had to be an as
11926, 1 ### i wake up to this every morning like a disney princess
11927, 1 ### it's a tiny jungle party
11928, 0 ### it doesn't matter how big or small they are
11929, 0 ### i'm an industrial engineer
11933, 0 ### my parents were very up for me going
11936, 1 ### in the mornings it is terrible and the afternoon is worst
11937, 1 ### the chairs are on the tables and still drinking and he drinks a lot
11938, 1 ### and on the other hand accordion the friendly bus he carries people in sweden brazilians
11939, 1 ### so when the only woman in your life is your mother you have a problem
11940, 1 ### and since we have people from uzbekistan kazakhstan tajikistan unclear we have to stop the program
11941, 0 ### every problem in a city has to have its own equation of co responsibility and also a design
11942, 0 ### but to make it happen sometimes you have to propose a scenario and to propose a design an idea that everyone or the large majority will help you to make it happen
11943, 0 ### and now there's cities all over the world that they are doing what they call the of curitiba
11944, 0 ### what in the design that made the difference is the boarding tubes the boarding tube gives to the bus the same performance as a subway
11945, 0 ### it's the concept of the city the design of the city that's also important too
11948, 1 ### maybe some of them are here now
11949, 1 ### inside all of us panting i sat a moment and i heard rafi telling his father father you can run faster than me
11950, 1 ### i shout like a true italian
11951, 0 ### it's a very logical plan but it was not always like this
11952, 0 ### this is the place where we make the legs
11953, 0 ### there were many other things to do
11955, 1 ### and once you make it there the big question is where to start
11957, 1 ### so then once you've done that the next stage is to know what it is
11958, 0 ### all right
11959, 0 ### it's in the northeastern part of ethiopia
11960, 0 ### first entertainment comes evidence from flutes that are years old
11963, 1 ### how come you know i'm sure that's something for a team of psychologists to examine
11964, 1 ### do you consider it possible there is that part of snowden we've not seen yet no i consider that absurd and idiotic
11965, 0 ### there is a very common sentiment that arises in this debate even among people who are uncomfortable with mass surveillance which says that there is no real harm that comes from this large scale invasion because only people who are engaged in bad acts have a reason to want to hide and to care about their privacy
11966, 0 ### what i want you to do when you get home is email me the passwords to all of your email accounts not just the nice respectable work one in your name but all of them because i want to be able to just troll through what it is you're doing online read what i want to read and publish whatever i find interesting
11967, 0 ### but equally essential to what it means to be a free and fulfilled human being is to have a place that we can go and be free of the judgmental eyes of other people
11969, 1 ### it was all good and then it started getting turbulent and bumpy and i was like i hope she can drive
11970, 1 ### in fact what they're suggesting is stare at awesome black people
11972, 1 ### i mean you've got to realize i go way back with black guys
11973, 1 ### you start to say things like grandma's a bigot
11974, 0 ### i'm going to turn on the radio
11975, 0 ### it could have been oscar grant
11976, 0 ### i mean i know we're not shooting people down in the street but i'm saying that the same stereotypes and prejudices that fuel those kinds of tragic incidents are in us
11978, 0 ### but it appears that when things get funky and a little troublesome a little risky i lean on a bias that i didn't even know that i had
11980, 1 ### you could also use the face network to hallucinate into this and you get some pretty crazy stuff
11982, 1 ### and the poetry is you know i think kind of not bad actually
11983, 0 ### the flip side of perception is creativity turning a concept into something out there into the world
11984, 0 ### because unlike say the heart or the intestines you really can't say very much about a brain by just looking at it at least with the naked eye
11985, 0 ### and these structures these cells that have these these branches that can go very very long distances this was very novel at the time
11986, 1 ### where i come from if you weren't a drag queen or a radical thinker or a performance artist of some kind you were the weirdo
11987, 1 ### when a kid behaves like i did they don't exactly have to come out right no one is exactly shocked
11988, 1 ### and i basically decided to photograph anyone in this country that was not percent straight which if you don't know is a limitless number of people
11989, 1 ### and i watched so many existential crises unfold in front of me
11990, 1 ### i'll take your picture just for trying
11993, 0 ### we bond together based on anything that we can music preference race gender the block that we grew up on
11995, 0 ### in fact no one in my life knew that i was a girl not my teachers at school not my friends not the directors that i worked with
11998, 1 ### when you ask that question you think people must be happier in california if say you live in ohio
12001, 0 ### and those are two very different concepts and they're both lumped in the notion of happiness
12004, 1 ### so the ultimate goal of psychoanalytic psychotherapy was really what freud called ordinary misery
12006, 1 ### i'm well red
12007, 1 ### i really loved this idea and i somehow was not focused on the idea that librarians as a class are sort of interested in spelling and i don't know
12010, 0 ### robin hood had this ambition to improve these buildings in some way but what they realized was to fix the buildings would be too expensive and impractical
12011, 0 ### so they did this wonderful thing where they brought in first then then more architects each one of whom was assigned a library to rethink what a library was
12012, 1 ### because it's an arranged marriage not a love marriage
12013, 0 ### on that occasion i found my wife carrying something like this
12014, 1 ### and i would like to know what the audience is and so who of you ever ate insects that's quite a lot
12016, 1 ### so that's one point for insects
12017, 1 ### so that's two points for insects
12019, 1 ### so that's three points for insects
12020, 1 ### so that's four points for insects
12021, 1 ### if we die out the insects will continue very happily
12022, 1 ### so there's even a lot of design to it
12023, 0 ### and here you see just a selection
12025, 0 ### and not only in the states but in any country in any economy
12026, 0 ### even larger animals eat insects
12027, 0 ### and here you see me enjoying a meal with caterpillars locusts bee delicacies
12028, 0 ### you're eating at least grams per year
12030, 0 ### where at the moment we have something between six and seven billion people it will grow to about nine billion in
12031, 0 ### our diet consists in some part of animal proteins and at the moment most of us here get it from livestock from fish from game
12032, 1 ### one of the stories she told was that if you eat a lot of salt all of the blood rushes up your legs through your body and shoots out the top of your head killing you instantly
12036, 0 ### it's just fun fierce and frivolous as frivolous as bubble gum
12039, 1 ### but now we want our partner to still give us all these things but in addition i want you to be my best friend and my trusted confidant and my passionate lover to boot and we live twice as long
12040, 1 ### and we think it's a given and toys and lingerie are going to save us with that
12041, 1 ### it's a powerful anti aphrodisiac
12042, 1 ### needing them is a shot down and women have known that forever because anything that will bring up parenthood will usually decrease the erotic charge
12043, 1 ### there is nobody at the reception desk
12044, 1 ### if everybody was fantasizing on a bed of roses we wouldn't be having such interesting talks about this
12046, 0 ### a crisis of desire as in owning the wanting desire as an expression of our individuality of our free choice of our preferences of our identity desire that has become a central concept as part of modern love and individualistic societies
12048, 0 ### we want to neutralize the tensions
12049, 0 ### or in other words i sometimes say fire needs air
12050, 0 ### so the first group is i am most drawn to my partner when she is away when we are apart when we reunite
12051, 0 ### i look at this person by the way in desire people rarely talk about it when we are blended into one five centimeters from each other
12054, 1 ### and clearly i wasn't starving
12056, 1 ### can you imagine saying that to somebody with a broken leg oh just walk it off it's all in your leg
12057, 1 ### so he's not a real doctor either
12058, 1 ### we decided to splurge and that week we would talk for minutes

12494, 1 ### for the in the audience i love what doing i admire the guts i admire the courage but your rockets are pointed in the wrong goddamn direction
12496, 1 ### the rational for the worlds first flight school goes something like when the come up to me and say they used to leave us alone when we were diving these goofy little spherical things but when we started flying around in underwater jet fighters they got a little nervous they would come up and say do you have a license for that and then id put my sunglasses on the beard that would all sprout out and i would say i need no stinking license
12498, 0 ### if you think that the relative importance two to one wrong by a factor of ten
12499, 0 ### the problem we have in believing that is you just have to give up this notion that this earth was created for us
12500, 1 ### for instance me and my sister when we were little we would compete to see who could eat the most squirrel brains
12501, 1 ### so i should talk about art

12509, 1 ### this one's called love song's nest
12511, 0 ### and the second thing that i was longing for was some more exquisite craftsmanship and technique
12513, 0 ### so i should start to talk about these guys
12514, 0 ### i'm under the river with those fish

12543, 0 ### very little water is wasted
12545, 0 ### she looks after goats in the morning but she's prime minister in the evening

12547, 1 ### trade off to trade that off for a focus
12548, 1 ### this as many of you have probably guessed is a recently emptied beer can in portugal
12552, 1 ### but i was in milan and saw this street sign and was very happy to see that apparently this idea of minimalism has even been translated by the graffiti artist

12569, 0 ### the sketches are in black and white here but in my mind they have colors
12570, 1 ### again none of this is new that's why shakespeare and the stoics were telling us this centuries ago but shakespeare never had to face emails in a day
12571, 1 ### i sometimes think i'd rather give up meat or sex or wine than the chance to check on my emails
12572, 0 ### and i really began to feel that if you were lucky enough to walk around the temples of tibet or to wander along the in havana with music passing all around you you could bring those sounds and the high cobalt skies and the flash of the blue ocean back to your friends at home and really bring some magic and clarity to your own life
12573, 0 ### and by going nowhere i mean nothing more intimidating than taking a few minutes out of every day or a few days out of every season or even as some people do a few years out of a life in order to sit still long enough to find out what moves you most to recall where your truest happiness lies and to remember that sometimes making a living and making a life point in opposite directions
12574, 1 ### he's thinking of course it's all a concept of injecting typefaces into i don't know how to say it in english in order to make them become to almost have a song or a whole poem written with every ejaculation
12575, 0 ### and it's great because it seems like every time i change jobs
12576, 1 ### i'm not sure why there is a hole in this particular man

12589, 0 ### the decade that we've just been through had relatively anemic job growth all throughout especially when we compare it to other decades and the are the only time we have on record where there were fewer people working at the end of the decade than at the beginning
12590, 0 ### so if these predictions are accurate that gap is not going to close
12591, 0 ### now we have multi language instantaneous automatic translation services available for free via many of our devices all the way down to
12592, 0 ### a lot of people look at this and they say ok but those are very specific narrow tasks and most knowledge workers are actually generalists

12620, 1 ### that's it that's the lecture
12622, 1 ### stay there charlie
12624, 1 ### ms okay
12626, 1 ### first no real sports fan would talk that way
12627, 1 ### why because what was at stake in the dispute over the golf cart was not only the essential nature of golf but the question what abilities are worthy of honor and recognition as athletic talents let me put the point as delicately as possible golfers are a little sensitive about the athletic status of their game
12628, 0 ### lying just beneath the surface of those arguments with passions raging on all sides are big questions of moral philosophy big questions of justice

12896, 1 ### and we had an opportunity to try that out in a community in the central part of rio which is called santa marta and we made a design for this place which looked like this and then we got people to go along with it because turns out that if your idea is ridiculously big it's easier to get people to go along with this
12897, 0 ### but somehow the idea stuck
12898, 0 ### we picked three houses in the center of the community and we start here
12900, 0 ### so for us this was an amazing moment because now because now we finally had the freedom to use all the lessons that we had learned and create a project that was built the same way that the favela was built from the ground on up bottom up with no master plan
12901, 0 ### so while this is happening we are bringing this idea all over the world
12902, 1 ### but there was a really interesting regulation which was they had to put a backseat light install it in every jitney to stop a new pernicious innovation which they called
12904, 0 ### so let me introduce you to the jitney
12906, 1 ### i'd like all of you to pause for a moment you wretched and take stock of your miserable existence
12907, 1 ### but all i learned about work life balance from that year was that i found it quite easy to balance work and life when i didn't have any work
12908, 1 ### and the reality of the society that we're in is there are thousands and thousands of people out there leading lives of quiet screaming desperation where they work long hard hours at jobs they hate to enable them to buy things they don't need to impress people they don't like
12909, 1 ### now i'm not talking here just about the bad companies the of the human soul as i call them
12910, 1 ### have sex again
12911, 0 ### the third observation is we have to be careful with the time frame that we choose upon which to judge our balance
12912, 0 ### meditate for half an hour
12913, 0 ### and i understand
12914, 0 ### i then walked him up the hill to the local cafe and we shared a pizza for two then walked down the hill to our home and i gave him his bath and put him in his batman pajamas
12915, 0 ### now my point is the small things matter
12916, 1 ### and ok so you could sex it up and like go to a much more mac you know but really it's the kind of same old crap we've had for the last you know years
12918, 0 ### it's kind of like a new approach to desktop computing
12920, 1 ### that splendid music the coming in music the elephant march from aida is the music i've chosen for my funeral
12922, 1 ### now of course we know that he didn't really mean that but in this country at the moment you can't be too careful
12924, 1 ### if you want to know what i have to say about darwinism itself i'm afraid you're going to have to look at my books which you won't find in the bookstore outside
12926, 1 ### lacking any coherent scientific argument for their case fall back on the popular phobia against atheism teach your children evolution in biology class and they'll soon move on to drugs grand larceny and sexual pre version
12928, 1 ### it's not a thing i often do so listen carefully
12930, 1 ### instead what i want to urge upon you is militant atheism
12931, 0 ### the god theory is not just a bad theory
12932, 0 ### good
12933, 0 ### and that's the end of the quote from douglas
12934, 0 ### he stood by it in the face of repeated calls for clarification or withdrawal
12936, 0 ### well i haven't seen the original studies and i can't comment on that meta analysis but i would like to see more studies done along those lines
12937, 0 ### when a critical mass has been obtained there's an abrupt acceleration in recruitment
12940, 0 ### but i think actually the alternative is to grasp the nettle of the word atheism itself precisely because it is a taboo word carrying of hysterical phobia
12942, 1 ### you have to have more things wrong than right
12943, 0 ### and rwanda has decided to become the technology hub or a technology hub on the continent
12944, 1 ### you can learn a lot about ancient diet and intestinal disease but they are very rare
12945, 0 ### and from these extracts we can reconstruct the human genome at different points in time and look for changes that might be related to adaptations risk factors and inherited diseases
12946, 1 ### so when i came to the security guard was standing on top of me and he said next time you little punks steal something you can carry
12950, 1 ### i wanted to find these rich white folks
12957, 0 ### everybody there was doing what they were doing to take what they wanted the drug dealers the robbers the blood bank
12958, 0 ### i was trapped in a cage prey among predators fighting for freedom i never had
12961, 0 ### according to the california department of corrections over percent of those incarcerated have committed or have been charged with money related crimes robberies burglaries fraud larceny extortion and the list goes on
12962, 1 ### at first the first thing i thought was i want to run away
12963, 0 ### it is a pity in a place that has such rich culture and traditions
12964, 1 ### and so this is your instrument ok
12965, 1 ### i grabbed a piece of graph paper i'm a physicist
12966, 0 ### so recently we have realized that the ordinary matter in the universe and by ordinary matter i mean you me the planets the stars the galaxies the ordinary matter makes up only a few percent of the content of the universe
12968, 1 ### but first see what a miserable lot we are
12969, 1 ### and as we like to say and i know there are a lot of americans in the audience here if americans want to live the american dream they should go to denmark
12970, 0 ### this again is life expectancy
12972, 1 ### so this book that i have in my hand is a directory of everybody who had an email address in
12973, 1 ### and then i thought nah that wouldn't be very nice
12974, 0 ### we didn't all know each other but we all kind of trusted each other and that basic feeling of trust permeated the whole network and there was a real sense that we could depend on each other to do things
12975, 0 ### it was actually interesting that such a communist principle was the basis of a system developed during the cold war by the defense department but it obviously worked really well and we all saw what happened with the internet
12977, 1 ### and then they shot him
12978, 1 ### now i like to point out that we were on that list with a lot of really cool places
12979, 1 ### i thought what a stupid website
12980, 1 ### and i came to the conclusion that we had built an incredible quality of life if you happen to be a car
12981, 1 ### well that's when all hell broke loose
12982, 1 ### when we look at the demographic shifts of people coming from the west it appears that what we're seeing now is the wrath of grapes
12983, 0 ### you're welcome
12984, 0 ### our banking industry our oil and gas industry our commercial real estate industry were all at the bottom of the economic scale
12986, 0 ### well i finally decided i needed to lose weight and i knew i could because i'd done it so many times before so i simply stopped eating as much
12987, 0 ### and as a result people tend to spread out
12988, 0 ### now the web address was
12989, 0 ### and the large companies they typically have wonderful wellness programs but the medium sized companies that typically fall between the cracks on issues like this they started to get engaged and used our program as a model for their own employees to try and have contests to see who might be able to deal with their obesity situation in a way that could be proactively beneficial to others
12991, 1 ### anybody who's ever worked with me will tell you i am known for my slogans
12993, 1 ### and that brings me to my third and final slogan
12994, 1 ### so i have to spend time with them so i manage the lunchroom every day
12995, 0 ### in one outburst ashley had expressed what i felt and never quite was able to articulate about my own experience when i attended a low performing school in the same neighborhood many many many years earlier
12998, 0 ### so i assembled a top notch leadership team who believed in the possibility of all the children and together we tackled the small things like every single locker combination by hand so that every student could have a secure locker
12999, 0 ### all during the school day
13001, 1 ### clouds
13002, 0 ### i know firsthand
13004, 1 ### i used to have a very romantic idea about villages and it's because i never lived in one
13005, 0 ### was mister natural for a while
13006, 1 ### but you open one of the garage doors and there is a professional size boxing ring inside
13007, 0 ### and you can imagine if you're a writer that things would get really crowded around deadlines
13008, 1 ### i mean show the colleges you care about others
13011, 1 ### what i'm saying is our kids need us to be a little less obsessed with grades and scores and a whole lot more interested in childhood providing a foundation for their success built on things like love and chores
13013, 0 ### but at the other end of the spectrum there's a lot of harm going on there as well where parents feel a kid can't be successful unless the parent is protecting and preventing at every turn and hovering over every happening and micromanaging every moment and steering their kid towards some small subset of colleges and careers
13014, 0 ### they're brittle
13015, 0 ### yeah
13018, 1 ### one in a toasted peanut skin and the other also adopted more on the beige side like a pancake
13019, 1 ### i chose one with the skin color of a lobster when
13020, 0 ### i was made of flesh but i wasn't pink
13021, 0 ### is a pursuit to highlight our true colors rather than the untrue white red black or yellow associated with race
13022, 1 ### i'm a guy who has graduated from bullshit to full shit
13023, 1 ### i don't know if we indians can be proud of such a distinction
13024, 0 ### and when we look at the reason for poor quality water you find that it is our abysmal attitude to the disposal of human waste
13025, 0 ### they decide to build a toilet and a shower room
13026, 1 ### and few things give me greater joy than a well designed flag
13027, 1 ### i put this picture online and sure enough within the first few minutes someone left a comment that said you can take that scottish and shove it up your ass
13028, 1 ### and i found it i am sorry to say sadly lacking
13031, 1 ### if you need to write the name of what you're representing on your flag your symbolism has failed
13032, 1 ### but city state and regional flags are another story
13035, 1 ### the first step is to recognize that we have a problem
13038, 1 ### and if you can't tell what city they go to yeah that's exactly the problem except for anaheim apparently they fixed it
13039, 1 ### you know yeah
13040, 1 ### rather than the whole coat of arms on a solid background and writing amsterdam below it they just take the key elements of the the shield and they turn it into the most city flag in the world
13043, 0 ### well i didn't know that that's ted kaye by the way
13045, 0 ### number three use two to three basic colors
13046, 0 ### when i left a guy passed me who had a chicago flag badge on his backpack
13047, 0 ### ok here we go ok
13049, 0 ### number five
13050, 0 ### there's a gigantic gear representing industry there's a ship recognizing the port a giant stalk of wheat paying homage to the brewing industry
13051, 0 ### but here's the trick if you want to design a great flag a kick ass flag like chicago's or which also has a great flag start by drawing a one rectangle on a piece of paper
13053, 0 ### emphasize those flames
13054, 0 ### as we move more and more into cities the city flag will become not just a symbol of that city as a place but also it could become a symbol of how that city considers design itself especially today as the populace is becoming more design aware
13060, 1 ### doing nothing at work is akin to masturbating at work it's totally inappropriate
13061, 1 ### now it turned out to be bill gates' doodle
13062, 0 ### so i discovered some very interesting things
13063, 0 ### and so because of that belief that i think needs to be burst i'm here to send us all hurtling back to the truth
13064, 1 ### we are looking down in the archive and when we are down into there is only austria and sweden that can produce numbers
13065, 1 ### and i'm going to stage a race here between this sort of yellowish ford here and the red toyota down there and the brownish volvo
13066, 1 ### that's the part where i sold the volvo and bought the toyota
13067, 1 ### that's when i believe statistics when it's grandma verified statistics
13068, 1 ### but they're very small you know they're so close to the hospital we can never beat them out in these forests
13069, 1 ### i lectured on this for ikea and they wanted to see the sofa immediately here
13070, 1 ### i only know two types of wine red and white
13073, 1 ### it's a cultural expression that for thousands of years has inspired human beings to think beyond the obvious
13074, 0 ### and if i could share the image with you on the screen
13075, 0 ### at that time there was a we and them
13079, 0 ### and it moves up with mao tse tung getting health not getting so rich
13080, 0 ### and down in the united states was a neighbor of india present contemporary india
13081, 0 ### there's a discrepancy in what's happening today in the emerging economies
13082, 0 ### this is really a change that you have this lag of more or less years' difference on the health
13091, 0 ### so this is an image of diana looking at camilla kissing her husband and this was a sequence of images
13094, 1 ### i had no idea this plastic cup was so powerful
13095, 0 ### only because her name happens to sound like a boy's was she able to finagle her way into the government immigration exam to come to the united states
13096, 1 ### okay
13097, 1 ### and as if that wasn't enough all of these incredibly complicating things right they wanted it in one shot
13098, 1 ### we went to home depot well over a hundred times
13099, 1 ### small stuff stinks but of course it's essential right what else planning is incredibly important
13100, 1 ### i think our enemy was physics and she's a cruel mistress
13101, 0 ### we'll be showing the video at the end but before we do i want to talk a little bit about what it is that they wanted
13102, 0 ### so we were really excited about working with them
13103, 0 ### so we came up with a list of requirements the commandments and they were in order of ascending difficulty the first is no magic
13104, 0 ### so we have this foot warehouse we were using divided between two floors
13105, 0 ### little balls in wooden tracks are really susceptible to humidity and temperature and a little bit of dust and they fall out of the tracks the exact angles makes it hard to get right
13106, 1 ### i know that in he no longer ruled the soviet union but that's the best picture that i can find
13107, 0 ### the first question there is why china has grown so much faster than india
13112, 1 ### and then one eight said hey why wouldn't you want to fly too and the whole room including me was like yeah
13113, 1 ### you don't look disabled
13114, 1 ### nobody calls her disabled
13115, 1 ### hours of prosthetic make up to get into a creature that had articulated paws claws and a tail that whipped around like a gecko
13117, 1 ### and she looked at me and she said but aimee that's not fair
13118, 0 ### that's why i was there i wanted to invite them to look and explore
13120, 0 ### she was the editor then of a magazine called id and she gave me a cover story
13121, 0 ### poetry matters
13122, 0 ### so we made what people lovingly referred to as glass legs even though they're actually optically clear polyurethane a
13123, 0 ### a prosthetic limb doesn't represent the need to replace loss anymore
13124, 1 ### and i was afraid not for myself but i was afraid that i was going to lose him that he was going to sink into one of his states and that i would ruin his relationship with the violin if i started talking about scales and and other exciting forms of didactic violin pedagogy
13127, 0 ### and we started talking about music from bach to beethoven and brahms bruckner all the b's from all the way up to
13130, 0 ### and so it was an incredibly painful time in my life and yet it really started to give me the humility to start listening
13133, 1 ### she said they don't want like the angry black man
13136, 1 ### because it suggests we should do something
13137, 1 ### that's a longer story
13139, 1 ### and so what do you do you go on vacation
13140, 1 ### i'm going to make a prediction
13141, 1 ### so once we do that i'll no longer be angry
13142, 0 ### it is absolutely possible
13145, 0 ### they created something that worked for them
13148, 0 ### they said it was the agrarian calendar and people had but let me tell you why that doesn't make sense
13151, 0 ### okay yeah there are two
13152, 1 ### none of those are on my bucket list
13153, 0 ### and unfortunately i'm sad to report that right now we might be in the grips of one of the most disastrous certainly of my career and one consistent is never end well
13154, 1 ### just bring it down a little
13156, 1 ### sh
13157, 1 ### i'm going to sing this to bill gates
13163, 0 ### and that's a poem by charles edward who was a stockbroker in new york city for years but in the evenings he wrote nonsense for his children
13166, 1 ### when i walked out on stage some of you may have been thinking this is going to be hilarious because everybody knows that fat people are funny
13167, 1 ### whereas some of you might have thought black would have been so much more slimming
13168, 1 ### you may have wondered consciously or not if i have diabetes or a partner or if i eat after
13171, 1 ### the impact of seeing a bunch of defiant fat women in flowery swimming caps and bathers throwing their legs in the air without a care should not be underestimated
13173, 0 ### we live in a culture where being fat is seen as being a bad person lazy greedy unhealthy irresponsible and morally suspect
13176, 0 ### there are doctors academics and who have written countless volumes on the many facets of this complex subject
13177, 0 ### the very idea of a fat dance work by such a prestigious company was to put it mildly controversial because nothing like it had ever been done on mainstream dance stages before anywhere in the world
13179, 0 ### by advocating for self determination and respect for all of us we can shift society's reluctance to embrace diversity and start to celebrate the myriad ways there are to have a body
13180, 1 ### that's an englishman asking an irishman to be succinct
13181, 1 ### i mean it's about three rolling stones farewell concerts away
13182, 0 ### three thousand years ago civilization just getting started on the banks of the nile some slaves jewish shepherds in this instance smelling of sheep shit i guess proclaimed to the pharaoh sitting high on his throne we your majesty ness are equal to you
13183, 0 ### they turn a social network from virtual to actual and kind of the century
13184, 1 ### see
13185, 0 ### i mean the functional impairment is clear
13186, 1 ### i think i'd like to stay in it forever
13188, 0 ### then at the age of eight we moved to botswana
13189, 0 ### but he didn't
13191, 1 ### for example i get people to dress up their vacuum cleaners
13192, 1 ### in the audience was asked to find a childhood photograph of themselves and restage it as an adult
13193, 1 ### this was a mother's day gift
13194, 1 ### i heard you were looking for me
13196, 1 ### i look at this photo and he seems really interested in what's going on with that button but it doesn't seem like he is really that interested in crossing the street
13197, 1 ### this is kind of like something i used to do in third grade
13198, 1 ### and i asked people to send me beautiful things made out of the
13199, 0 ### and this is what came to me
13202, 0 ### this was at a distance realizing that someone was feeling something wanting to affect them in a particular way using media to do it putting it online and realizing that there was a greater impact
13203, 0 ### and have to do something with it
13205, 0 ### and so i said let's put this together in an album
13206, 0 ### our conversation started with me saying bored and her replying i'm bored i eat pretzels
13207, 0 ### he died long after he left the pillow at my house but we never got around to returning it
13212, 1 ### and they said absolutely not
13213, 0 ### it's hard for me to believe that it's been years since i had the experience of being a ninth grade kid in birmingham alabama a kid who loved getting a's a kid who loved math who loved to read a kid who would say to the teacher when the teacher said here are problems to the class this little fat kid would say give us more
13215, 1 ### i believe our cars can talk about us behind our backs
13216, 0 ### i was a young driver out on the highway and the car in front of me i saw the brake lights go on
13217, 0 ### i felt the abs kick in and the car is still going and it's not going to stop and i know it's not going to stop and the air bag deploys the car is totaled and fortunately no one was hurt
13218, 1 ### what i'd like you to do is just really quickly is just sort of nod to the person on your right and then nod to the person on your left
13219, 1 ### if this was a group of beekeepers you would have everyone from the card carrying member who's you know live free or die to the you know the self expressed quirky san francisco backyard pig farmer
13220, 1 ### okay thanks
13221, 0 ### and here we see a picture on top of a hill in central valley last december
13222, 0 ### it was called that because a guy in israel first found it and he now regrets profoundly calling it that disease because of course there's the implication
13223, 0 ### and so this opens up the whole idea of looking at colony health
13225, 1 ### maybe you thought that was scary but actually there's no amount of drugs you can take that can get you as high as if you think you're jesus christ
13227, 0 ### maybe no one's really crazy
13228, 1 ### she's at the ted prize
13229, 1 ### no pun intended
13230, 1 ### people started to ask me where is this guy now al offered him a job
13231, 1 ### now josh rushing actually ended up leaving the military and taking a job with al
13232, 0 ### wow some of you watched it
13233, 0 ### this is donna at the statue of liberty
13234, 0 ### but i'd like to talk about another way to travel that doesn't require a ship or an airplane and just requires a movie camera a projector and a screen
13235, 0 ### there was a center there where they were teaching people how to read and write and get vaccinations against the many diseases you can get from sorting through garbage
13236, 1 ### eight hundred two liter soda bottles oh yea
13237, 0 ### it adds together the interference pattern from two raindrops that land near each other
13238, 1 ### but when i was united states poet laureate and i love saying that
13240, 1 ### one of my students came up after class an introductory class and she said you know poetry is harder than writing which i found both erroneous and profound
13241, 1 ### he says that if at first you don't succeed hide all evidence you ever tried
13243, 1 ### and then he'd come down to new york city and i'd teach him what i knew which was largely smoking and drinking
13244, 1 ### but then again it took us a long time to put the wheel and the suitcase together
13245, 0 ### and surely if you're reading a poem that mentions a cow you don't need on the facing page a drawing of a cow
13246, 0 ### so let us start with the first one
13247, 0 ### some days i put the people in their places at the table bend their legs at the knees if they come with that feature and fix them into the tiny wooden chairs
13248, 0 ### it is as if one by one the memories you used to harbor decided to retire to the southern hemisphere of the brain to a little fishing village where there are no phones
13250, 0 ### so the little poem is called the dead
13252, 1 ### my name's and the title of my talk is still figuring it out and the ms paint quality of my slides was a total creative decision in keeping with today's theme and has nothing to do with my inability to use
13253, 0 ### and this is not true and actually reconciling all the contradictions i was feeling became easier once i understood that feminism was not a rulebook but a discussion a conversation a process and this is a spread from a zine that i made last year when i i mean i think i've let myself go a bit on the illustration front since
13254, 1 ### they don't seem to suffer from the same fear of heights that humans do
13255, 1 ### and it would be a lovely thing to be able to wave to someone and have all our wave at the same time
13257, 0 ### in recent historic times about percent of the coast redwood forest was cut down especially in a series of bursts of intense liquidation logging clear cutting that took place in the through the early
13260, 1 ### you know it's heartbreaking
13261, 1 ### i don't know whether i should be saying that in an open forum but i was really impressed
13263, 1 ### i said you know your marriage is the subject of global obsession
13264, 1 ### it's all about the truth
13267, 0 ### trying to tell the world what we were seeing brought us accusations of bias of siding with one side of not seeing the whole side and just you know trying to tell one story
13268, 0 ### so that is where for me i understood that objectivity means giving all sides an equal hearing and talking to all sides but not treating all sides equally not creating a forced moral equivalence or a factual equivalence
13271, 0 ### i mean people have written about this phenomenon
13274, 1 ### it was very easy and you can write many books very fast about it
13275, 1 ### but i tell you at this point people listened to me
13276, 1 ### it's so complicated
13277, 1 ### so where did this come from obviously from extraterrestrials
13278, 0 ### i prefer the word roughness to the word irregularity because irregularity to someone who had latin in my long past youth means the contrary of regularity
13280, 0 ### now it didn't take me any time
13281, 0 ### so the eye after a while can distinguish these two very well
13283, 0 ### we see mountains in the distance
13284, 1 ### we busted a lot of balloons
13285, 0 ### i have the incredible good fortune to work at a factory
13287, 1 ### if that had been a dog i would have laid him out
13288, 0 ### it's a difficult choice right rear end owner
13289, 0 ### we don't take the dog's point of view into account
13292, 1 ### so it turned out that not only was the billboard still up but they had put this one right next to it
13293, 1 ### and since i'm a big list maker i actually listed them all
13295, 1 ### so you could drive up into the mountains freely blasting the police on the new sony walkman
13296, 0 ### or they had this apple by yoko ono that of course later on was you know made into the label for the beatles
13297, 0 ### now what i took away from the exhibit was that maybe with the exception of the most of the pieces in there were actually about the visualization of happiness and not about happiness
13298, 0 ### you know that's not a big deal to accomplish
13299, 0 ### you're just in there watching the incredible subtle changes of color in the sky
13300, 0 ### try not to get stuck doing the same thing or try not get stuck behind the computer all day
13301, 0 ### and then we did one more of these
13302, 1 ### well i hadn't thought of that one
13303, 1 ### and when i try to explain my work to her she waved away all the details and she said neil there's only one question that really matters
13304, 0 ### people wonder you know how do you have time to do this and so on
13305, 0 ### we had an amazing childhood
13306, 1 ### and how can you avoid being annoyed by her i just take off my and i don't hear anything
13307, 1 ### i know he doesn't hear well because i've heard him do karaoke
13308, 0 ### and when it comes to sensory restoration we're still very far away from being able to provide beauty
13309, 0 ### now i'd like to impress upon you how unusual it is that we can hear music
13310, 1 ### because imagine my motivation standing between this strong healthy crowd
13311, 1 ### there's this quote when push comes to shove you gotta do what you love even if it's not a good idea
13315, 0 ### i frequently ask how many have heard of any other political party and there's always just scattered hands in the audience compared to this first question which is one half to two thirds
13317, 0 ### they had six million between them and we beat them
13318, 1 ### you can see this most clearly when you take away someone's watch and you shut them into a bunker deep underground for a couple of months
13319, 0 ### we evolved as a species near the equator and so we're very well equipped to deal with hours of daylight and hours of darkness
13320, 1 ### i get a great sense of comfort from looking at an excel spreadsheet even very simple ones
13321, 1 ### and these faults would release these petrochemical fumes from underneath the earth's crust and the oracle literally sat right above these faults inhaling enormous amounts of ethylene gas these fissures
13324, 1 ### they enjoyed it
13325, 0 ### it would take a couple of days and then eventually she would come out of it giving you her predictions as your answer
13327, 0 ### so because of all of this our oracle is a billion industry
13328, 0 ### i study and i advise companies on the patterns of how people use technology and one of my interest areas is data
13329, 0 ### so i did things like working as a street vendor selling dumplings to construction workers
13330, 1 ### if your name was harry baker then our names would be the same
13331, 1 ### so i thought i'd start with a love poem about prime numbers
13332, 1 ### that reaction is why i didn't
13337, 1 ### and i became a prime number themed poetry competition winner or as i like to call it a prime minister
13339, 1 ### it was people from all around the world speaking in their native languages to be judged by five french strangers
13340, 1 ### and we could watch paper tv and it would all be pay
13341, 1 ### wed see the poppy paper rappers rap about their paper package or watch paper people carriers get stuck in paper traffic on the
13342, 1 ### if you weren't here it would be pretty much like the sound check yesterday
13348, 0 ### maybe pop up purple paper people
13354, 0 ### and a paper population is no different
13356, 1 ### we decided to do something that was the very opposite of everything we'd been taught to do as journalists share
13357, 1 ### is coming he used to say
13358, 1 ### they'd been using the address to register their offshore company
13359, 1 ### shortly after we published i got a three word text from johannes has arrived
13360, 0 ### it represented the biggest cache of inside information into the tax haven system that anyone had ever seen
13361, 0 ### giant corporations operate on a global level
13362, 0 ### and this has plunged journalism into crisis forcing those institutions to reexamine how they function
13364, 1 ### and it's pretty incredible because i took my there and he was like yeah do you want an upgrade yes
13365, 1 ### so
13366, 0 ### so before i start i want to talk about a little anecdote a little story about a man i met once in
13367, 0 ### it's actually happening in all parts of the country
13368, 1 ### and no this isn't burning man or san francisco
13369, 1 ### now chimpanzees are well known for their aggression
13370, 1 ### it might be the evolutionary origin of the phrase she's got him by the balls
13373, 0 ### they live in the depths of the jungle and it has been very difficult to study them
13375, 0 ### play is the glue that binds us together
13376, 0 ### the secret is that play is the key to these capacities
13377, 0 ### in times when it seems least appropriate to play it might be the times when it is most urgent
13379, 1 ### computer a young boy is holding a baseball bat
13380, 1 ### computer a man riding a horse down a street next to a building
13381, 0 ### li this is a three child describing what she sees in a series of photos
13382, 0 ### we have made fabulous cameras but we have not delivered sight to the blind
13383, 0 ### why is this so hard you may ask
13386, 1 ### and its the first time had a job where im afraid to go away because of everything going to happen in this week when im here
13387, 1 ### im in entertain amaze mode
13388, 1 ### so in such a relational universe if you come upon something ordered and structured like this device here or that device there or something beautiful like all the living things all of you guys in the room guys in physics by the way is a generic term men and women
13389, 1 ### and i also think that science will never go away and im finishing on this line
13390, 0 ### and i want to talk about three stages in that evolution
13391, 0 ### so that is both aristotelian cosmology and in a certain sense medieval society
13392, 0 ### in a newtonian universe no center thank you
13393, 0 ### now in the century we had a revolution that was initiated at the beginning of the century and which is still going on
13394, 1 ### when you're in the middle of the sea under a hundred foot crane trying to lower eight tons down to the sea floor you start to wonder whether i shouldn't have taken up watercolor painting instead
13395, 0 ### one sculpture became two
13397, 1 ### and by the way that's me
13399, 0 ### now in this search we were trying to actually find the dry limit for life on earth a place so dry that nothing was able to survive in it
13401, 1 ### so you can kind of see how misleading averages can be
13402, 1 ### and they're certainly not inscrutable if you really wanted to test these numbers on volume you could grab a bottle and try it for yourself
13403, 1 ### a poll might speak to a couple hundred people maybe a thousand or if you're l'oreal trying to sell skin care products in then you spoke to women to claim that they work
13404, 0 ### but before i do i just want to clarify which numbers i'm talking about here
13405, 0 ### i don't need to tell anyone here that there are a lot of dividing lines in our society right now and a lot of them start to make sense once you understand people's relationships with these government numbers
13406, 0 ### right now there's a bill in congress about measuring racial inequality
13408, 1 ### and you see these notes in my hand because i'm also a black preacher
13410, 1 ### i'm talking about before pagers
13411, 1 ### y'all know what i'm talking about
13412, 1 ### if i was a natural police department and i represented a police department you would see this incredible beautiful arm
13416, 1 ### you see after three years of my four in that district three years in after putting pastors in the car with my police because i knew this it's a little secret i knew this it was hard to stay a nasty police officer while you're riding around with a clergy
13418, 0 ### and even with that my personal truth is that law enforcement is in a crisis
13419, 0 ### and yet all the while still we continue in the same vein the same vein that contradicts everything that we just admitted
13420, 0 ### and so now over the next months i shifted and i transcended from being a drug sergeant ready to retire as a drug sergeant and went from level to level to level until i find myself as a district commander commander of the worst district in baltimore city
13424, 0 ### see here's the thing i had to figure out a way to shift cops that were under my tutelage from being occupiers of communities to being partners
13425, 0 ### and because we are a proud profession it is very hard for us to look in the mirror and see our mistakes
13426, 0 ### too much
13428, 1 ### then to clarify she went on he was not an environmentalist
13430, 1 ### and then i saw the obvious link because even we liberals love this country
13432, 0 ### you don't necessarily have to win but you must do extremely well
13434, 1 ### the reason we're not sure absolutely is because of the nature of evidence preservation in our judicial system but that's another whole talk for later
13435, 1 ### now i may have used a tone which was more like a dare than a request but nonetheless it's to this man's credit and his courage that he said yes i will
13439, 0 ### the police investigating officers were amazingly efficient
13441, 0 ### first of all we have all the statistical analyses from the innocence project work where we know that we have what documented cases now where people have been wrongfully convicted and subsequently exonerated some from death row on the basis of later analysis and you know that over three quarters of all of those cases of exoneration involved only eyewitness identification testimony during the trial that convicted them
13442, 0 ### it's called reconstructed memories
13444, 1 ### you need three lessons and they need to be terribly profound
13445, 1 ### it was very very very emotional and one night we were sitting around the campfire and i have to be honest i think i'd had a little bit too much to drink and i was sort of sitting under the stars going this is great you've seen my pictures we love each other
13446, 1 ### so if you can briefly reflect on what i was discussing about beauty and about belonging and about our ancestors and our roots and i need you all to stand for me please
13447, 0 ### i've got the family spent the better part of a day talking with them
13448, 0 ### i want it to be hanging on the horizon so it lights these people in all the potential glory that they could be presented
13449, 0 ### i've got my sheet and the light's gone and i can't make the picture
13450, 1 ### now i think that we can all agree that mathematicians are famously excellent at finding love
13452, 1 ### of all of the available women in the all peter's looking for is somebody who lives near him somebody in the right age range somebody with a university degree somebody he's likely to get on well with somebody who's likely to be attractive somebody who's likely to find him attractive
13453, 1 ### and comes up with an estimate of women in the whole of the
13454, 1 ### and so to try to persuade you of how totally amazing excellent and relevant mathematics is i want to give you my top three mathematically verifiable tips for love
13455, 1 ### but my particular favorite is that it turns out that on an online dating website how attractive you are does not dictate how popular you are and actually having people think that you're ugly can work to your advantage
13456, 0 ### because i know just as well as all of you do that love doesn't really work like that
13458, 0 ### it's this spread that makes you more popular on an online internet dating website
13459, 0 ### so he recorded what was said in the conversation he recorded their skin conductivity he recorded their facial expressions their heart rates their blood pressure basically everything apart from whether or not the wife was actually always right which incidentally she totally is
13460, 0 ### but actually the mathematics and subsequent findings by the team have shown the exact opposite is true
13461, 0 ### so those are my top three tips of how can help you with love and relationships
13464, 1 ### and if you look back about the forecasts on surveillance by george orwell well it turns out that george orwell was an optimist
13465, 1 ### in fact percent of the planet are foreigners
13468, 0 ### we estimate that just the electricity bill for running this data center is going to be in the tens of millions of dollars a year
13469, 0 ### i'm not arguing that at all but that's not what programs like prism are about
13470, 1 ### but coach those people are really important and smart
13471, 1 ### cool it better be good coach
13472, 1 ### it makes me really popular these days
13473, 1 ### just don't be a slut
13474, 1 ### from behind i didn't appear to be either to her
13475, 0 ### the whole room went silent
13476, 0 ### never have we had numbers this high
13477, 0 ### they rebuilt their lives starting from scratch and eventually became independently wealthy jordanian citizens
13478, 0 ### i didn't want to
13479, 0 ### don't ever think people are beneath you or that you have nothing to learn from others
13480, 1 ### this is what the internet looked like when it was born and you can call that the internet of middle aged white men mostly middle aged white men
13483, 0 ### so i learned to follow hunches even though you can't necessarily justify them or know where they're going to go
13485, 1 ### in fact i'm leaving
13486, 1 ### if you're at a dinner party and you say you work in education actually you're not often at dinner parties frankly
13487, 1 ### if you work in education you're not asked
13490, 1 ### thank you very much
13493, 1 ### and the girl said they will in a minute
13494, 1 ### when my son was four in england actually he was four everywhere to be honest
13498, 1 ### and the third boy said frank sent this
13500, 0 ### and she's exceptional but i think she's not so to speak exceptional in the whole of childhood
13501, 0 ### what we do know is if you're not prepared to be wrong you'll never come up with anything original if you're not prepared to be wrong
13502, 0 ### picasso once said this he said that all children are born artists
13503, 0 ### everywhere on earth
13504, 0 ### number one that the most useful subjects for work are at the top
13505, 0 ### if you think of it the whole system of public education around the world is a protracted process of university entrance
13509, 0 ### we'll be back we won't be very long and they went and left her
13513, 0 ### by the way we may not see this future but they will
13514, 1 ### now logic logically you have got to this position from this without moving the wrist
13515, 1 ### but it was six moves
13516, 1 ### the other guys can talk about cheers
13518, 1 ### now so i think number three i have arranged them in a full house
13519, 1 ### so good
13520, 1 ### thank you
13522, 1 ### and so arthur benjamin did a little of the same thing
13523, 1 ### when i'm sober i do this much quicker but we will check
13526, 1 ### oh i forgot i shouldn't shuffle but i think actually my technique is to peek all the time
13527, 1 ### then i calculate yeah good
13528, 1 ### so i will do it quick very quick but in slow motion so you can follow
13529, 1 ### so another person another card
13530, 1 ### yes that's difficult to find a card here
13531, 1 ### my fault
13533, 1 ### so now that was the reason right you see the cards yes
13536, 1 ### queen
13537, 1 ### pardon audience armani
13538, 1 ### audience stop
13539, 1 ### yes good good
13541, 1 ### go ahead
13542, 1 ### you can take the nostril too because some guys think some guys think i can peek through the nostril so do more
13544, 1 ### just kidding warming up king of hearts
13545, 1 ### you just got to this is a request from the lady in the back
13546, 0 ### not you
13549, 0 ### so we have an agreement
13550, 0 ### so here you see the contrast when i treat the cards
13551, 0 ### these look in order i'm probably hopefully yeah
13552, 0 ### next is a term i do it quick
13553, 0 ### you agree but if you square square and shuffle and then a cut
13555, 0 ### jack of spades
13556, 0 ### you said spades audience yes
13557, 0 ### i like to so i know where it is
13558, 0 ### five of clubs
13559, 0 ### i think we save five of clubs
13560, 0 ### for example you are sitting in las vegas and you're betting and you let the other guys peek this card by mistake
13567, 0 ### audience diamonds
13571, 0 ### i never ever miss two
13575, 0 ### seven
13578, 1 ### why precisely not to have to cooperate with my wife
13582, 0 ### the hard structure processes systems
13585, 1 ### and we gave him the bali of plastic bags speech and being a very nice man he said imitating the man's voice i cannot believe what i'm about say but i'm going to give authorization to collect signatures behind customs and
13588, 1 ### and conversely that highlights those who do not have the sticker
13591, 0 ### and we have had some significant successes
13595, 0 ### she's a real inspiration
13600, 1 ### he was where madison didn't speak to a woman expect for once until he was years old and then married dolley and lived happily ever after for years
13603, 1 ### hamilton responded to this by saying that madison was nave that he was childish and that his goal was to turn the united states into a primitive self reliant and completely ineffectual on the global scale
13604, 1 ### of course he blamed the press
13605, 0 ### that technology is the constitution
13606, 0 ### in a period of time of just three years from to he had conceived theorized designed passed and gotten ratified the us constitution
13607, 0 ### one of them told madison who can't have liked it very much that hamilton was the newton of infrastructure
13608, 0 ### so these two founders who had been such close friends and such close allies and such partners then began to produce enmity
13609, 0 ### madison became the secretary of state his friend and mentor jefferson became president and they actually over time managed to put the federalists completely out of business
13610, 1 ### one said to me our people used to gather in cafes to watch football or soccer as we say in america and now they gather to watch parliament
13611, 0 ### but before was a global symbol of liberation there were representative surveys already giving people a voice in quieter but still powerful ways
13612, 1 ### we'll read a text we'll talk about it we'll have a potluck dinner
13614, 1 ### now remember i was the only man in this group so when i witnessed this i went oh no
13619, 1 ### and that by the way is why i think men so often wear ties
13622, 0 ### i give a guest lecture for her when she teaches
13625, 0 ### it is good for the kind of lives we want to live because young men especially have changed enormously and they want to have lives that are animated by terrific relationships with their children
13626, 0 ### so when men share housework and childcare their children are happier and healthier and men want this
13629, 1 ### i don't know if they're together now but i can find out
13630, 0 ### this guerrilla and the main group is the guerrillas revolutionary armed forces of colombia they have financed their war by kidnapping by extortion by getting into the drug trade by illegal mining
13632, 1 ### the bad news was that to do it he had to drive at miles an hour constant speed and got pulled over by the cops
13633, 1 ### just between us
13636, 1 ### we dressed a cowboy as johnny cash and bolted the mannequin to the rocket
13637, 0 ### in fact even if producing was good for the environment given that we're going to run out of hydrocarbons we need to find some sustainable means of operating
13638, 0 ### if you put that same fuel in an internal combustion engine car you get about percent efficiency
13640, 0 ### and then it also has the lowest drag coefficient of any car of its size
13641, 0 ### so we wanted really to have people feel as though they've almost got to mind meld with the car so you just feel like you and the car are kind of one and as you corner and accelerate it just happens like the car has
13642, 1 ### i want to start today talk about the structure of a
13643, 1 ### just be profound
13647, 1 ### which is a savings
13650, 1 ### hey hey hey get away from abrams years ago if we wanted to do that we'd have to kill a
13657, 1 ### and i learned this very early on in my career don't hurt tom's nose
13658, 1 ### so tom is playing two roles
13660, 0 ### he started selling surplus parts kits to schools and stuff
13662, 0 ### the scoring of it the printing of it where the thing gets glued the registration marks for the ink
13663, 0 ### and it let me make things which to me was sort of the dream
13666, 0 ### now it's not the most ground breaking idea but when i started to think that maybe there are times when mystery is more important than knowledge
13672, 0 ### the meet the mysterious woman
13674, 0 ### and then finally there's this idea stretching the paradigm a little bit but the idea of the mystery box
13676, 1 ### or to say as alan greenspan did i know you think you understand what you thought i said but i'm not sure you realize that what you heard is not what i meant
13677, 1 ### they're mit undergraduates
13678, 1 ### he says the wind should get in trouble for switching the sandwiches
13680, 1 ### when you start talking about using magnetic pulses to change people's moral judgments that sounds alarming
13681, 1 ### i mean they're calling but i'm not taking the call
13682, 1 ### why it's not called the hard problem of consciousness for nothing
13684, 0 ### some observations on the slow development of this system as we learn how to do this difficult job
13685, 0 ### this is the first pirate
13687, 0 ### and while ivan is away the wind comes and it blows the sandwich down onto the grass
13688, 0 ### so that one is his
13689, 0 ### so now joshua goes off to get a drink
13690, 1 ### i'm coming home
13691, 0 ### now this is a very attractive idea and the molecules they mention sound really science y
13694, 1 ### no slouching no pants hanging down none of that stuff
13695, 1 ### that's all over his page and it's gone viral
13697, 1 ### see if it works
13698, 1 ### i wanted to see if my memory was correct and my god it was
13699, 1 ### average which i shouldn't have been allowed in with and then i started out in engineering and that only lasted six months
13701, 1 ### so they shipped me off to the army and lo and behold many years later i'm considered one of the greatest sons the city college of new york has ever had
13702, 1 ### we'll get another kid
13703, 1 ### they never left
13704, 1 ### they never cooked
13705, 1 ### gotta have a dirty water dog
13709, 0 ### you'll notice that the building is rather austere
13710, 0 ### i say now listen
13711, 0 ### and then we introduce them to somebody who they come to hate immediately the drill sergeant
13712, 0 ### and that's just the way it is
13713, 0 ### i'm telling you you didn't shave
13714, 0 ### and so we need more of this kind of structure and respect in the lives of our children
13715, 0 ### it's part of the answer
13718, 0 ### and i watched my own young grandchildren now come along and they're much to the distress of my children they are acting just like we did
13720, 0 ### every child ought to have a good start in life
13721, 0 ### that's what's going on
13722, 0 ### we don't have time to waste for that
13724, 0 ### that's how the system's supposed to work
13726, 1 ### i know you think of yourself as human beings but i think of you as or percent bacterial
13727, 1 ### this is like the stealth bomber of the ocean
13728, 1 ### this is the bacterial esperanto
13729, 0 ### they just grow and divide and grow and divide so a kind of boring life except that what i would argue is that you have an amazing interaction with these critters
13730, 0 ### so there's all kinds of bacteria on the earth that have no business being in you or on you at any time and if they are they make you incredibly sick
13731, 0 ### the clue to this came from another marine bacterium and it's a bacterium called
13732, 1 ### i think is a really terrible idea
13733, 1 ### it's just that when we agree about our hallucinations we call that reality
13734, 1 ### all you need is one of these
13735, 1 ### and the idea is that the congruence between seeing touch and feeling touch on an object that looks like hand and is roughly where a hand should be is enough evidence for the brain to make its best guess that the fake hand is in fact part of the body
13736, 0 ### coming round from anesthesia is very different
13739, 0 ### you don't have to be smart to suffer but you probably do have to be alive
13740, 1 ### the funny thing was we had to break into the parking lot too so we totally felt like we were legit in the whole graf scene too
13741, 0 ### and that was the onset of als
13742, 1 ### but i'm not just going to click see photo what i'm actually going to do is spend the next minutes
13743, 0 ### specifically it feels like little bits of my time get slipped away to various things like this like technology i check things
13748, 1 ### so now when you think about this what we have here is a ham butt problem
13750, 1 ### do you know what that says to me that says to me it was friday afternoon and somebody wanted to go down the pub
13751, 0 ### it's made up of lots of little bits
13752, 0 ### but what people really often think about the dictionary is they think more like this
13753, 0 ### and when parts of your job are not easy or fun you kind of look for an excuse not to do them
13756, 1 ### i want to ask you now though to think maybe from your own experience or maybe just imagine it about the difference between the intensity of the experience under the wedding canopy and maybe the experience of the sixth or seventh anniversary
13757, 0 ### i remember the night that i read about the series of coordinated bombings in the subway system in madrid and i got up and i walked over to the crib where my six baby girl lay sleeping sweetly and i heard the rhythm of her breath and i felt this sense of urgency coursing through my body
13760, 1 ### and another percent of those same young adults said that another major life goal was to become famous
13761, 1 ### the harvard men never ask that question
13762, 1 ### and when about a decade ago we finally asked the wives if they would join us as members of the study many of the women said you know it's about time
13764, 0 ### but through a combination of luck and the persistence of several generations of researchers this study has survived
13765, 0 ### and the second group that we've followed was a group of boys from boston's poorest neighborhoods boys who were chosen for the study specifically because they were from some of the most troubled and disadvantaged families in the boston of the
13766, 1 ### it doesn't surprise me that in this climate many of our institutions for the provision of health care start to look a heck of a lot like jiffy lube
13767, 0 ### what i'm most interested in as a scientist is the how of science
13768, 1 ### of course there are the bases which refer to specific sexual activities that happen in a very specific order ultimately resulting in scoring a run or hitting a home run which is usually having vaginal intercourse to the point of orgasm at least for the guy
13769, 1 ### i could go for some pizza
13774, 0 ### so we need a new model
13777, 0 ### you just take your position and play the game
13778, 1 ### as you can probably imagine my roommates didn't like that at all
13779, 1 ### for example your name or your name
13780, 0 ### it just printed the pieces overnight
13781, 0 ### but i had a few issues with them
13782, 1 ### the younger maybe not
13784, 0 ### the first is physiological
13786, 1 ### but i don't look like my
13789, 0 ### i was just obsessed with taking things apart and building things and just anything i could do with my hands or with wood or electronics or metal or anything else
13790, 1 ### and these buttons there those are chicken eggs
13791, 1 ### i got that staircase for dollars including delivery to my lot
13792, 1 ### well if that ruins your life well then you shouldn't live there
13793, 1 ### if not it goes into the toilet
13794, 1 ### after all it's not just a question of hygiene but there's a possibility of recreation as well
13795, 1 ### it looks a little phallic but after all it's a bathroom
13796, 1 ### that'll keep bull elephants out i promise
13798, 1 ### and then the faucet is a beer tap
13799, 1 ### then somebody gave me a so it got a
13800, 1 ### if i took a bite out of it you'd go wait a second
13801, 1 ### that's one of those new chocolate cell phones
13804, 0 ### it's a pretty panel of glass
13805, 0 ### human beings have a need for maintaining consistency of the mass
13806, 0 ### if i have of these of those it makes no difference what these and those are
13808, 0 ### if something isn't perfect if it doesn't line up with that premeditated model dumpster
13809, 0 ### oops warped
13810, 0 ### and there's a story jim one of the guys i trained i said jim it's time now
13811, 0 ### and he was out there with a tape measure going through the trash heap looking for header material or the board that goes over a door thinking he'd impress his boss that's how we taught him to do it
13812, 0 ### we can't get out of it
13813, 0 ### we like to hang together in groups just like just like lions
13815, 0 ### we have confused hierarchy of needs just a little bit
13817, 0 ### and i don't wear ammo belts crisscrossing my chest and a red bandana
13818, 1 ### okay
13819, 1 ### that's a little harsh but still
13821, 1 ### so it's conceivable if god were to exist he might wonder i'm eternal i'm all powerful but where did i come from whence then am i god speaks in a more formal english
13822, 1 ### if we let our desires melt away we'll see the world for what it truly is a nothingness and we'll slip into this happy state of nirvana which has been defined as having just enough life to enjoy being dead
13823, 1 ### don't believe him
13825, 1 ### it might be instead percent malevolent but only percent effective which pretty much describes the world we see around us i think
13828, 1 ### so okay
13832, 0 ### he doesn't need any preexisting materials to fashion a world out of
13833, 0 ### so it's god nothing the world
13834, 0 ### that tells us what naked reality really is that reveals what i call the true and ultimate furniture of the universe
13835, 0 ### but i've got a big problem with it and the problem is this it's a pseudo religious point of view
13839, 0 ### it's as far removed from nothingness as it could possibly be
13840, 0 ### then there's the most elegant possible reality
13841, 0 ### we're here
13842, 1 ### you actually just did that
13843, 1 ### shut up
13844, 1 ### and this is a small excerpt from a longer piece
13845, 1 ### perfect
13847, 1 ### first try once on purpose once on purpose how about if i try first and then decide good idea
13849, 1 ### oh it's time for richard's help
13850, 1 ### oh sorry
13851, 1 ### put your hands out like this please
13854, 0 ### i think so that's right
13856, 0 ### all right here we go
13857, 0 ### you wouldn't think it would affect half the stage but it is
13861, 0 ### to back
13862, 1 ### two hours of chemistry class in a language that you don't yet fully understand can be a pretty good sedative
13865, 0 ### it was like a fairy tale his strong arms around me laying me in the safety of my bed
13866, 1 ### this is the size of the earth going through that same frame
13869, 1 ### and the building was poorly placed actually
13871, 0 ### i've tried to show in this though the color doesn't come out that what i'm concerned with is the little time bubble that you are in
13872, 0 ### now the human part related to animals look at the left side of that
13878, 1 ### we've got some of the most incredible video of titanic that's ever been seen and we're not going to show you any of it
13879, 1 ### here's the x wing death jelly
13880, 1 ### that's how they like to live
13882, 1 ### you could never get a permit to dump this in the ocean and it's coming out all from it
13883, 1 ### here's a crab with his claw right at the end of that tube worm waiting for that worm to stick his head out
13884, 0 ### part of the problem i think is we stand at the beach or we see images like this of the ocean and you look out at this great big blue expanse and it's shimmering and it's moving and there's waves and there's surf and there's tides but you have no idea for what lies in there
13885, 0 ### we have to have a very special technology to get into that unfamiliar world
13886, 0 ### it gets up to about feet long
13888, 0 ### this is really a world within a world and we're going to show you two
13889, 0 ### it's footage that we've collected for scientific purposes
13890, 1 ### today's talk is about brains and yay i have a brain fan out there
13891, 1 ### i found a website dedicated to teachers who want to make script writing things across the top of their blackboard and they had added graffiti to it and i'm sorry about that
13892, 1 ### i said no you're wrong and i didn't get in
13893, 1 ### that's when i designed all those computer products
13894, 1 ### woo
13895, 1 ### so some people have fallen into the pit of metaphysical dualism some really smart people too but we can reject all that
13896, 1 ### it's the thing on the top of your head that got because it got shoved in there and doesn't fit
13898, 1 ### you're going to see things more like intelligent cars that really understand what traffic is what driving is and have learned that cars with the on for half a minute probably aren't going to turn
13899, 0 ### i'm going to talk all about that
13900, 0 ### in september of scientific american came out with a single topic issue about the brain
13901, 0 ### and he wrote a story basically saying this is all well and good but you know we don't know squat about brains and no one has a clue how they work so don't believe what anyone tells you
13902, 0 ### so i fell in love with this
13903, 0 ### they said you can't study theory about brains
13905, 0 ### sometimes a science will tell something about ourselves it'll tell us who we are
13906, 0 ### this is one too because when we understand how brains work we'll be able to build intelligent machines
13907, 0 ### the theorist guy says i think this is what's going on the experimentalist says you're wrong
13908, 1 ### and i said to her i don't understand why you're not a feminist because you know you live in america
13910, 1 ### until recently whenever i took part in an international conference or festival i would be usually one of the more depressed speakers
13911, 1 ### and we would smile at each other in sympathy this camaraderie of the doomed
13912, 1 ### and you could call us worried and depressed writers international club
13914, 1 ### those of us who used to be very depressed for a long time we started to feel less depressed whereas the newcomers they were so not used to feeling this way that they were now even more depressed
13915, 1 ### so you could see writers from bangladesh or turkey or egypt trying to console their colleagues from britain or from post election usa
13920, 0 ### but i think this is a mistake for two main reasons
13922, 0 ### but there was hope
13923, 0 ### sometimes it draws circles even slides backwards and that generations can make the same mistakes that their great grandfathers had made
13924, 1 ### once though he agreed to make false papers for someone you might recognize
13925, 0 ### let me introduce him
13926, 1 ### i thought if i skipped it might help my nerves but i'm actually having a paradoxical reaction to that so that was a bad idea
13927, 1 ### anyway i was really delighted to receive the invitation to present to you some of my music and some of my work as a composer presumably because it appeals to my well known and abundant narcissism
13928, 1 ### okay i wrote that
13930, 0 ### i can also understand that sort of implicit criticism in this piece s which i made when i was living in copenhagen
13931, 0 ### here's another example from another piece and then its realization
13933, 0 ### okay so that gives you a little taste of that piece
13934, 1 ### all you need is an internet connection and a funny cat
13936, 1 ### she paused and said i don't know if that's yuan or american dollars but anyway it's
13940, 0 ### they choose to leave their homes in order to earn money to learn new skills and to see the world
13941, 0 ### if you tell them more they won't understand anyway
13942, 1 ### it's really amazing that all this stuff is here
13943, 0 ### and yet it's here
13944, 1 ### but the academicians couldn't understand anything that he wrote
13945, 1 ### how many digits are there in your number two so you should have sat down earlier
13948, 0 ### now symmetry is almost nature's language
13949, 0 ### but on a larger scale of biology actually symmetry is very important because it actually communicates genetic information
13950, 1 ### so i took the experiment out of delhi and repeated it this time in a city called in the center of india where i was assured that nobody had ever taught anybody anything
13951, 1 ### and as soon as they saw me they said we need a faster processor and a better mouse
13952, 0 ### now by remoteness i mean two or three different kinds of things
13953, 0 ### the guess was that schools in remote areas do not have good enough teachers
13956, 1 ### i mean many of you probably have said i am monogamous in all my relationships
13957, 1 ### i've been asked that question since i arrived at this conference
13958, 1 ### so percent of us will say that it is terribly wrong for our partner to lie about having an affair but just about the same amount of us will say that that's exactly what we would do if we were having one
13959, 1 ### and i've also told quite a few of my patients that if they could bring into their relationships one tenth of the boldness the imagination and the verve that they put into their affairs they probably would never need to see me
13960, 1 ### now you've listened to me and i know what you're thinking she has a french accent she must be pro affair
13964, 0 ### when marriage was an economic enterprise infidelity threatened our economic security
13965, 0 ### and infidelity tells me i'm not
13966, 0 ### now i question everything
13967, 0 ### nick just left on a business trip and heather is playing on his with the boys when she sees a message appear on the screen can't wait to see you
13968, 0 ### but then we have another paradox that we're dealing with these days
13969, 0 ### and if the situation were reversed nick would be in the same situation
13973, 1 ### i need you to go upstairs past the fire and i need you to get this woman a pair of shoes
13975, 0 ### thank you
13976, 1 ### and so even if we make those very important decisions for very silly reasons it remains statistically true that there are more georges living in georgia and there are more becoming dentists and there are more who are married to paul than statistically viable
13977, 1 ### then of course i looked at my mom and my dad karolina and karl and and and josef
13978, 0 ### it was a little bit too funky and we wanted a more feminine point of view and employed a duck who did it in a much more fitting way fashion
13979, 0 ### in that year what i did do a lot was look at all sorts of surveys looking at a lot of data on this subject
13981, 1 ### so this is something that we're now going to try for the first time live and this is really truly very frightening
13982, 1 ### what the hell are you guys oh sorry
13983, 1 ### one of them is to take that real
13984, 0 ### so as we zoom in beyond a certain level this resolves into a kind of sim city like virtual view at degrees
13985, 0 ### but i'm going to show you some more candy sort of stuff
13986, 0 ### i'm live
13987, 0 ### all right and now there's one last ted talk that microsoft has given in the past several years
13988, 1 ### you can ask the question who's the boss you'll be able to figure that out
13990, 1 ### and that actually makes pretty hard for all of us which is i guess why they gave a tv show to the guy who was like really great at
13991, 0 ### and some people actually thought it gave you heightened sensitivity and conferred creative genius
13992, 1 ### he in fact there is a story that when he wanted to learn how to swim he read a book a treatise on swimming then dove into the ocean
13993, 1 ### it took so long to get these ants to do this
13994, 1 ### one of the other predictions of string theory no that's not one of the other predictions of string theory
13995, 0 ### so i'd like to tell you something about the story of these extra dimensions
13996, 0 ### all of that could be described using newton's work
13997, 0 ### the idea goes like this imagine space is a substrate of all there is
13998, 1 ### and so i want to tell you about that first and then go on into where i think love is going
14000, 1 ### and there's also many more male idiots in the world
14002, 1 ### and he knew from our work that if you go and do something very novel with somebody you can drive up the dopamine in the brain and perhaps trigger this brain system for romantic love
14004, 0 ### their wine glass at dinner is different from every other wine glass at the dinner party
14005, 0 ### but anyway not only does this person take on special meaning you focus your attention on them
14008, 0 ### before i put these people in the machine i would ask them all kinds of questions
14010, 1 ### rob legato i pretend they're clapping for me
14011, 1 ### and i guess somebody thought they needed to do that
14014, 1 ### it's like yeah i don't know if you noticed but i'm the guy out in the parking lot recreating one of america's finest moments with fire extinguishers
14017, 0 ### i got the feeling that my brain wanted to basically see it come back to life
14018, 0 ### so what i did is basically i had another screening room experience where i was basically tracking where i was looking or where we were looking and of course you're looking at the two people on the bow of the ship and then at some point i'm changing the periphery of the shot i'm changing it's becoming the rusted wreck and then i would run it every day and then i would find exactly the moment that i stopped looking at them and start noticing the rest of it and the moment my eye shifted we just marked it to the frame
14019, 0 ### so what you're now going to see is how we actually did it
14020, 1 ### imagine you're in a bar or a club and you start talking and after a while the question comes up so what do you do for work and since you think your job is interesting you say i'm a mathematician
14024, 1 ### and those who stand in defense tell you even if you don't realize it friend math is behind everything
14029, 0 ### eternal truths
14030, 0 ### not circles those leave little gaps
14032, 1 ### at one point a congressional staffer said that there was no way that i was going to be confirmed by the united states senate because of my past despite the fact that i had been in recovery for over years and despite the fact that this job takes a little bit of knowledge around addiction
14033, 0 ### you see i grew up in a family riddled with addiction and as a kid i also struggled with coming to terms with my own sexuality
14037, 1 ### i mean here you have these guys who basically thought they were just following this hunch this little passion that had developed then they thought they were fighting the cold war and then it turns out they're just helping somebody find a soy latte
14038, 0 ### because before the spread of coffee and tea through british culture what people drank both elite and mass folks drank day in and day out from dawn until dusk was alcohol
14039, 0 ### and so it's not an accident that a great flowering of innovation happened as england switched to tea and coffee
14040, 1 ### he brought me a middle eastern dessert from jerusalem where he lives and i brought him kosher chocolate and held a god hates jews sign
14041, 0 ### the end of my antigay picketing career and life as i knew it came years later triggered in part by strangers on who showed me the power of engaging the other
14043, 1 ### it's a good thing ours is bigger because we're also really insecure
14044, 1 ### if your companions suddenly startle and fly away it does not work very well for you to say jeez i wonder why everybody just left
14045, 1 ### he'll get the job done and it will feel good
14046, 1 ### when human beings use one thing to represent another we call that art
14049, 0 ### the first neurons came from jellyfish
14050, 0 ### this is an ancient partnership that we have just recently found out about
14051, 0 ### we make perfect sense of that image just as they make perfect sense of what they're doing because under the arc of the same sun on the same plains listening to the howls of the same dangers they became who they are and we became who we are
14052, 1 ### it's a story about us people being persuaded to spend money we don't have on things we don't need to create impressions that won't last on people we don't care about
14054, 1 ### we're too busy keeping out the giraffes putting the kids on the bus in the morning getting ourselves to work on time surviving email overload and shop floor politics foraging for groceries throwing together meals escaping for a couple of precious hours in the evening into prime time tv or ted online getting from one end of the day to the other keeping out the giraffes
14056, 0 ### the irony is though that we have cashed out prosperity almost literally in terms of money and economic growth
14057, 0 ### and our best avenue of escape from this actually is a kind of blind faith in our own cleverness and technology and efficiency and doing things more efficiently
14061, 1 ### wish that would work on me too
14065, 1 ### my personal dream is to build a mud skyscraper right in manhattan
14066, 0 ### the challenge was to build our own shelter with whatever we could find
14067, 0 ### and this is what i tried to do with my architecture as well
14068, 0 ### and i'm sure you all had your hands in mud or clay before
14070, 0 ### and because the main part of the building budget was spent on craftsmanship the school wasn't just a building it became a real catalyst for local development and that made me happy
14071, 0 ### and finally we need good built projects that prove you can build with an ancient material in a very modern way
14072, 1 ### until last year when i felt the weight of my age on my shoulders the first time i opened
14073, 1 ### today i use it
14074, 0 ### this is an exact copy of the chat
14075, 0 ### de river was her name
14076, 1 ### perhaps overlooked invention of the battery for the first time also demonstrated the utility of a professor
14078, 1 ### you know i've got to tell you one of the greatest benefits of being a professor colored chalk
14080, 0 ### with a giant battery we'd be able to address the problem of that prevents wind and solar from contributing to the grid in the same way that coal gas and nuclear do today
14081, 0 ### it's a new form of energy storage that i invented at mit along with a team of my students and post
14082, 0 ### we need to think about the problem differently
14084, 1 ### by the way feel free to check in on my head at any time
14088, 1 ### losing concentration
14089, 0 ### our vision is to introduce this whole new realm of human interaction into human computer interaction so that computers can understand not only what you direct it to do but it can also respond to your facial expressions and emotional experiences
14090, 1 ### this is that piece installed in a gallery in new york those are my parents looking at the piece
14091, 1 ### well actually i only had one that i scanned lots and lots of times
14092, 0 ### or when you overeat because your feelings are hurt or whatever
14093, 0 ### we use four million cups a day on airline flights and virtually none of them are reused or recycled
14094, 1 ### there are mushrooms that grow faster than printed parts
14095, 0 ### it has a symmetry such that you can't injection mold it
14096, 1 ### maybe he's worried that he's going bald
14097, 1 ### right you'd never want to play
14099, 1 ### ten percent of the time people's minds are wandering when they're having sex
14100, 0 ### we're richer
14101, 0 ### in fact in the last few years there's been an explosion in research on happiness
14103, 0 ### maybe these people are right
14105, 1 ### now in our company this is what we call the pinky suck moment
14106, 1 ### and farmers could protect their crops that they want to sell to whole foods because our photons are percent organic
14107, 1 ### and then you could decide is this an insect i want to kill or an insect i don't want to kill moore's law made computing cheap so cheap we can weigh the life of an individual insect and decide thumbs up or thumbs down
14108, 1 ### so this sounds really crazy right would you like to see it yeah okay so our legal department prepared a disclaimer and here it is
14109, 1 ### next we can actually light them up with a laser
14114, 0 ### so we made this thing
14115, 0 ### because if you open it up and reach inside you'd let the heat in the game would be over
14117, 0 ### you can try to treat people and create awareness
14118, 0 ### you don't always use them for that
14119, 0 ### one of those ways might be better diagnosis
14121, 1 ### so as it turns out ted was not founded in ad
14122, 0 ### this grew into a passion for finding things a love for the past and archaeology
14123, 0 ### this is a site located in the eastern egyptian delta called mendes
14126, 1 ### when we think about the dreams we have and the dent we want to leave in the universe it is striking to see how big of an overlap there is between the dreams that we have and projects that never happen
14127, 1 ### but if no one invested in your idea if no one bought your product for sure there is something there that is your fault
14129, 1 ### believe me you do that and you will destroy your dreams
14130, 0 ### if you go investigate further the guy has done apps before and he has done a master's on the topic a
14131, 0 ### people may think it's an overnight success but that only worked because for the years prior to that i took life and education seriously
14132, 0 ### no one else has the perfect answers for your life
14133, 0 ### when i wrote a sequel some impact was guaranteed
14134, 1 ### my tongue larynx and vocal cords were still healthy and unaffected
14135, 1 ### i tried out various computer voices that were available online and for several months i had a british accent which chaz called sir lawrence
14137, 1 ### but i've got to say in first grade they said i talked too much and now i still can
14138, 1 ### but i'm not here from the chamber of commerce
14139, 1 ### i joined compuserve when it had fewer numbers than i currently have followers on
14140, 1 ### but no you don't
14141, 1 ### believe me he didn't mean this as anyway let me just read it
14142, 1 ### one of the funniest on the web is written by a friend of mine named cripple
14143, 1 ### the psychiatrist says all right you're ugly
14144, 0 ### after surgeries for cancer took away my ability to speak eat or drink i was forced to enter this virtual world in which a computer does some of my living for me
14145, 0 ### suddenly i had an episode of catastrophic bleeding
14146, 0 ### human speech is an ingenious manipulation of our breath within the sound chamber of our mouth and respiratory system
14147, 0 ### when i find myself in a conversational situation i need to type fast and to jump right in
14149, 0 ### but i decided then to just give it a try
14150, 0 ### this is the first version of my computer voice
14151, 0 ### it makes me feel good that many of the words you are hearing were first spoken while i was commenting on casablanca and citizen kane
14152, 0 ### he said he recorded many long hours in various to be used in the voice
14153, 0 ### for almost all the years of life on earth there was no intelligent life
14154, 1 ### absolutely that's right it's sex
14155, 1 ### but sex everybody is doing it but nobody wants to talk about it
14156, 1 ### in these as in so many other matters islam offers us at least shades of gray
14157, 0 ### this is the modern middle east where two millennia after the coming of christ virgin births are still a fact of life
14158, 0 ### that i chose to look at sex comes from my background in as a writer and a researcher and an activist
14159, 0 ### but the arab spring has changed all that in uprisings which have blossomed across the region since
14160, 1 ### this is with a method that we call in my lab graduate student with tweezers
14162, 1 ### we're designing environments that make us crazy
14164, 1 ### some of my best friends are architects
14165, 1 ### or who say don't spend all your budget on a huge screen in the conference room and then place one tiny microphone in the middle of a table for people
14166, 0 ### sound affects us physiologically psychologically and all the time
14167, 0 ### a room like this has acoustics this one very good acoustics
14169, 0 ### they had to go back in and spend pounds putting the walls in
14170, 1 ### we've also learned the penguins love robots
14171, 0 ### it's built with mostly off parts and costs about times cheaper than the james cameron used to explore the titanic
14172, 1 ### so again we got the short end of the deal there
14173, 1 ### so we imagine that we would actually potentially even host a bake sale to start our new project
14174, 0 ### and it's really a of urban population rising biodiversity plummeting and also of course sea levels rising and climate changing
14175, 0 ### so we need new stories new heroes and new tools
14176, 1 ### basically what it told me was the kinds of countries we prefer are good countries
14177, 1 ### what does this mean this means that as we go to sleep at night all of us in the last seconds before we drift off to sleep our final thought should be i'm glad that ireland exists
14178, 0 ### it's brought a lot of bad stuff like the stuff that i just described but it's also brought a lot of good stuff
14179, 0 ### that's clearly what we've got to do next
14180, 1 ### but the first few systems were these leaky loud power guzzlers that martha stewart would definitely never have approved
14181, 1 ### but what we call it is or research and develop it yourself
14182, 0 ### now at the time that i was reading this it was the middle of the winter and i definitely did not have room for a lot of dirt in my new york city apartment
14183, 0 ### fast forward two years later we now have window farms which are vertical hydroponic platforms for food growing indoors
14184, 1 ### and i also learned that it can be helpful to think about girls
14185, 0 ### we all heard about the importance of stories yesterday
14186, 1 ### now all of the babies even in berkley like the crackers and don't like the raw broccoli
14187, 1 ### my son is
14188, 1 ### okay so his first hypothesis has just been falsified
14189, 1 ### what's making this light up
14191, 1 ### oh
14192, 1 ### so what's it like to be a baby it's like being in love in paris for the first time after you've had three double
14193, 0 ### one thing that this baby could be thinking about that could be going on in his mind is trying to figure out what's going on in the mind of that other baby
14194, 0 ### and then she would take a little bit of the crackers and she'd go yuck crackers
14196, 0 ### so children both know more and learn more than we ever would have thought
14197, 0 ### if we look across many many different species of animals not just us primates but also including other mammals birds even like kangaroos and wombats it turns out that there's a relationship between how long a childhood a species has and how big their brains are compared to their bodies and how smart and flexible they are
14198, 0 ### and chickens and ducks and geese and turkeys are basically as dumb as dumps
14201, 1 ### and playboy is always in the top few
14203, 1 ### in the context of the film this is a deep space battle station of the galactic empire capable of planets and civilizations and in reality it measures about four feet by two feet
14204, 0 ### they didn't want to let my camera in because it confronts constructed realities myths and beliefs and provides what appears to be evidence of a truth
14205, 0 ### and the outsider can never really reach the core
14208, 1 ### we went from a back rudder to a front rudder to two to multiple to the whole boat changing shape and the more we are moving forward and the more the design looks simple and cute
14209, 1 ### we're working on also simpler technology not that complex with younger people and also older people like this dinosaur is from mexico
14211, 0 ### so i wanted to develop something that we could develop very fast that would be cheap and that would be open source so because oil spills are not only happening in the gulf of mexico and that would be using renewable energy
14212, 1 ### relax on where your shadow always has company
14213, 1 ### so please don't email me one of your crazy theories
14214, 0 ### and in the last two decades astronomers have found thousands of
14216, 1 ### so adolescence is defined as the period of life that starts with the biological hormonal physical changes of puberty and ends at the age at which an individual attains a stable independent role in society
14217, 1 ### so this is a soccer game
14218, 1 ### after puberty that became the threat
14220, 0 ### so studies looking at the development of this region have shown that it really undergoes dramatic development during the period of adolescence
14221, 0 ### it's partly dependent on the environment that the animal or the human is in and the that are being used are strengthened and that aren't being used in that particular environment are pruned away
14222, 0 ### and we think that might be because adolescents and adults use a different mental approach a different cognitive strategy to make social decisions and one way of looking at that is to do behavioral studies whereby we bring people into the lab and we give them some kind of behavioral task and i'll just give you another example of the kind of task that we use in my lab
14224, 1 ### and i recently said that to a venture capitalist casually at some valley event to which he replied how quaint
14225, 1 ### we're going to reprogram the bacteria in your gut and we're going to make your poo smell like peppermint
14227, 1 ### i've seen this video but i still don't know if it's going to end right
14228, 0 ### so this talk is going to be about how do we make things and what are the new ways that we're going to make things in the future
14229, 0 ### literally think of proteins as that you can string together to execute a program
14230, 0 ### and from the results of the same competition last year a university of texas team of students programmed bacteria so that they can detect light and switch on and off
14231, 0 ### and so this is our muse tucker
14233, 1 ### walk up to it and smack it on the backside
14234, 1 ### puff up and just look it in the eye and it may not want to fight you
14237, 0 ### i come from a region in the remote northwest part of the country
14239, 0 ### we lived under apartheid regime
14240, 0 ### they could sell these things for anything between a kilo
14242, 1 ### and she called poverty a personality defect
14243, 1 ### it's like brad pitt says in fight club too often we're working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don't need
14245, 1 ### martin luther king didn't say i have a nightmare
14246, 0 ### but the underlying assumption is the same there's something wrong with them
14248, 0 ### a few months later i heard that eldar a professor at princeton university and one of the authors of this study was coming over to holland where i live
14249, 0 ### so the long term perspective goes out the window
14250, 1 ### so if you make them this big by using i suppose then you could have a thousand times as many
14251, 1 ### and whatever you do don't read anything about genetics that's published within your lifetime or something
14254, 1 ### genetic algorithms are great for certain things i suspect i know what they're bad at and i won't tell you
14257, 0 ### pollution energy shortage environmental diversity poverty
14258, 0 ### sometimes you get an extra one or drop one out but so you can skip the grandparent and great grandparent stage and go right to the great
14259, 0 ### they're both wonderful and largely the same except that computers happened in between
14260, 1 ### when you buy a pie the whole family has to agree and apple is everyone's second favorite
14262, 1 ### now you're in your element
14264, 1 ### and then afterward i said sir i want to give you the periodic table in case you're ever in a bind and need to calculate molecular weight
14265, 1 ### i thought molecular weight sounded much less nerdy than mass
14266, 1 ### i'll look at it periodically
14267, 1 ### now if we could scale this you could actually use it to run your which is kind of my dream to be able to drive a virus powered car
14268, 0 ### i've been fascinated by how nature makes materials and there's a lot of secrets to how they do such an exquisite job
14271, 0 ### and very rapidly they became multi cellular they could replicate they could use photosynthesis as a way of getting their energy source
14273, 0 ### now going back to the abalone shell the abalone makes this shell by having these proteins
14274, 1 ### so if you stagger into the head late at night and you're so toilet hugging sick that you forget to turn on the light you may think that you're having a religious experience
14275, 1 ### his only hope for existence on this planet is as a
14276, 1 ### so this little guy has found himself this babe and you will note that he's had the good sense to attach himself in a way that he doesn't actually have to look at her
14277, 1 ### his flesh fuses with her flesh her bloodstream grows into his body and he becomes nothing more than a little sperm sac
14278, 1 ### and we have this photograph posted in our lab in a place of honor with the caption engineer satisfying two women at once
14279, 0 ### it was an evening dive
14280, 0 ### and there are a few other land dwellers that can make light some insects earthworms fungi but in general on land it's really rare
14281, 0 ### and inside the sphere with me is an intensified camera that's about as sensitive as a fully dark adapted human eye albeit a little fuzzy
14282, 0 ### and so here in the gulf of maine at feet i can name pretty much everything you're seeing there to the species level
14283, 0 ### in the nobel prize in chemistry was awarded for work done on a molecule called green fluorescent protein that was isolated from the chemistry of a jellyfish and it's been equated to the invention of the microscope in terms of the impact that it has had on cell biology and genetic engineering
14284, 1 ### people normally write that down by the way
14285, 1 ### now i liked it better when viruses were free
14286, 0 ### so today computer viruses and trojans designed to do everything from stealing data to watching you in your to the theft of billions of dollars
14287, 0 ### check out this one i found
14288, 1 ### and for those of you who understand healthcare economics you know that all wealthy countries spend between nine and percent of on health care except for the united states we spend but that's a story for another day
14289, 0 ### the percentage of working families without health care up by four percent
14291, 1 ### maybe you've heard of us
14292, 1 ### and the truth is that no one really cares what you say when you're that age
14293, 1 ### insert halloween costume here
14295, 1 ### what you are is a
14297, 0 ### i worried that there was something wrong with this and something wrong with me for being unable to stick with anything
14299, 0 ### sha hwang and rachel drew from their shared interests in data visualization travel mathematics and design when they founded
14300, 0 ### when become interested in something we go hard
14301, 0 ### thank you
14302, 1 ### the daffodils were blooming but the referees were not blowing the whistle when i was telling them to
14303, 1 ### funny they're very friendly to me before the opening tip but they really ignore me during the game
14307, 1 ### so i wrote this feminist op ed it is entitled forget your team it is your online gender violence toward girls and women that can kiss my righteous ass
14310, 1 ### i'm really cute
14311, 0 ### she is the absolute worst
14312, 0 ### since i joined in misogyny and have amply demonstrated they will dog my every step
14316, 0 ### and i learned that revenge porn is often dangerously misapplied
14318, 0 ### i'm going to offer just a few and of course i challenge you to create and contribute your own
14320, 1 ### the winner boxes the air and kisses the ground throws his shirt as though somebody is waiting for it
14321, 1 ### there is no shortcut it is like swimming by swimming
14322, 1 ### you learn cooking by cooking having some sympathetic people around you to eat what you cook
14323, 1 ### and therefore what i say you have to fake it and make it
14324, 1 ### this is the mantra of the united states of america
14325, 0 ### it can't afford to doubt the person who tends the child
14326, 0 ### therefore it has to blame itself a wordless blame which is more difficult to really resolve the wordless self blame
14327, 0 ### the self you are self aware
14328, 0 ### each one has got two games
14329, 0 ### no human heart is denied of that empathy
14330, 1 ### and it's so tempting to think that it's all about me
14331, 1 ### this is the closest to an oriental feast that you will ever get in vienna
14332, 1 ### in tel aviv they come to my concerts
14337, 1 ### he means mozart which is like a third seat from the center
14339, 1 ### so he had to resign
14340, 1 ### it says never look at the trombones it only encourages them
14347, 1 ### he says you start when you can't stand it anymore
14348, 1 ### next video please
14349, 1 ### they do need to go to a for two weeks later
14350, 0 ### you know this little office of the conductor
14351, 0 ### i hope you'll think it's a good example of harmony
14354, 0 ### people who build this wonderful concert hall
14356, 0 ### yeah so clear
14357, 0 ### or he is actually transferring a very strong message to them saying come on guys
14360, 0 ### he says this is the gesture of the music
14361, 0 ### that's what he does
14364, 0 ### see he is there percent but not commanding not telling what to do
14365, 0 ### you see that first of all it's a kind of a compliment we all like to get
14367, 0 ### and all you put together in partnership brings about the best music
14370, 1 ### it would be like a near death experience where you see the light at the end of the tunnel but it's a total death experience
14371, 1 ### but if you were to float by in space on a space holiday and you heard this you want to get moving
14372, 0 ### and with all of our modern telescopes we've been able to collect this stunning silent movie of the universe these series of snapshots that go all the way back to the big bang
14373, 0 ### now black holes are dark against a dark sky
14374, 1 ### isn't that terrific so we've been as i say very successful very lucky in having companies catch the vision of this from cars car makers who want to put a stereo system in the front for the kids and a separate system in the back oh no the kids aren't driving today
14375, 1 ### we've got the military have just deployed some of these into iraq where you can put fake troop movements quarter of a mile away on a hillside
14376, 1 ### i took it back to the pentagon after it got declassified when the patent issued and told the people back there about it and they laughed and then i took them back a demo and they bought
14377, 0 ### and it was the hardest invention i ever made but it got me started and i got really lucky after that
14379, 0 ### ultimately we figured out how to make things like lasers that were totally focused
14381, 1 ### ever cheaper labor and ever faster machines
14382, 1 ### because you don't want to get an unfortunate juxtaposition where you're talking about one thing instead of the other
14383, 1 ### and unfortunately it doesn't work so well anymore either
14384, 1 ### every town that has a volunteer fire department understands this way of thinking
14385, 1 ### but they always stop and take a picture
14387, 0 ### but we don't think about it that way
14389, 0 ### they persisted
14390, 0 ### and then he went to north carolina and did it again
14391, 0 ### it is a moment in time
14392, 0 ### henry ford comes up with a really cool idea
14393, 0 ### and you can build an entire industry on that
14394, 1 ### and that's all true
14396, 1 ### hockey
14397, 1 ### he hung out with the beatles
14399, 1 ### this man was so powerfully that he once fell asleep in the middle of his own speech
14400, 0 ### i read the same headlines that you do
14401, 0 ### it turns out that there are remarkable signs of progress out there often in the most unexpected places and they've convinced me that our great global challenges may not be so unsolvable after all
14403, 0 ### then part two trudeau created the world's first policy of official multiculturalism to promote integration and the idea that diversity was the key to canada's identity
14404, 0 ### it's also hot huge and unruly made up of islands where people speak close to a thousand languages
14406, 1 ### so i was leafing through it wondering if i had any mental disorders and it turns out i've got
14408, 1 ### i've got parent child relational problems which i blame my parents for
14409, 1 ### i didn't know which of these was true but i thought it was kind of interesting and i thought maybe i should meet a critic of psychiatry to get their view which is how i ended up having lunch with the scientologists
14410, 1 ### and brian the scientologist whispered to me they're medicated which to the scientologists is like the worst evil in the world but i'm thinking it's probably a good idea
14412, 1 ### it could be carnage by the end of the night
14419, 1 ### which i have to say would have been hard for him to deny because he was standing under a giant oil painting of himself
14420, 1 ### he said that's leadership
14422, 1 ### but she's married so i'm going to have to get her split up from her husband
14426, 0 ### he looked like a man who wanted to wear an outfit that would convince me that he was very sane
14427, 0 ### and i was in prison awaiting trial and my said to me know what you have to do fake madness
14428, 0 ### so i said to the psychiatrist get sexual pleasure from crashing cars into walls
14429, 0 ### and they didn't send him to some cushy hospital
14432, 0 ### so faking your brain going wrong is evidence that your brain has gone wrong
14433, 0 ### so i did
14435, 0 ### so whenever he said anything to me that just seemed kind of non psychopathic i thought to myself well i'm not going to put that in my book
14436, 0 ### and the gems are always the outermost aspects of our personality
14437, 0 ### and he said i'm not a psychopath
14441, 0 ### what has changed our society has been wireless devices
14442, 1 ### she said all these people with eastern dress walking up and down very repetitive very limited
14443, 1 ### she said who is this charles bonnet she said did he have them himself and she said tell all the nurses that i have charles bonnet syndrome
14445, 1 ### so you may not only have car cells you may have aston martin cells
14446, 1 ### and now it's in there somewhere
14447, 1 ### have you yourself experienced any of the syndromes you write about i was afraid you'd ask that
14448, 0 ### they don't seem to be of our creation
14449, 0 ### i went in to see her
14450, 0 ### but he has huge teeth on one side of his mouth
14451, 0 ### they come to a certain point and then stop
14453, 0 ### she had no control over them
14454, 1 ### so it's a slight misquote
14455, 1 ### the actual truth about the specific bush kerry incident is that the bush kerry articles were locked less than one percent of the time in and it wasn't because they were contentious it was just because there was vandalism which happens sometimes even on stage
14457, 1 ### i was describing this in berlin once and the next day in the newspaper the headline said i am the queen of england
14459, 1 ### and i said well they don't all hate it
14460, 0 ### it's written by thousands of volunteers all over the world in many many languages
14462, 0 ### and i'm going to tell you what the cost of is
14463, 0 ### we're in many many languages
14464, 0 ### so the servers are managed by a ragtag band of volunteers
14467, 1 ### if you aren't at least a bit disturbed by something i tell you here you're just not paying attention
14469, 1 ### i highly recommend avoiding this outcome
14472, 1 ### they remember a life of leisure
14476, 0 ### this copy would remember everything the same and if it starts out with the same speed looking at the same speed it might even need to be told you are the copy
14477, 0 ### first by definition do what the human they emulate would do in the same situation
14478, 0 ### when creatures are rich like you you have to know a lot about what they want to figure out what they do
14480, 1 ### and by now some of you may be asking yourselves and i just want to reassure you that i did get half the money up front
14481, 1 ### it's shocking isn't it now some of you might be saying at this moment in time oh yeah but ok hang on a second there
14484, 0 ### she was stiff and her little lifeless hand was curled into itself
14485, 0 ### after all it is as old as existence itself
14488, 1 ### but when i'm sitting in my car after an hour and a half of commute every day that reality looks very different
14491, 1 ### with that amount of time ancient egyptians could have built pyramids of giza
14493, 1 ### the result a strange traffic that mixes the fast and smooth rigor of german and the creative vitality of the intersections of
14495, 0 ### wow i thought our vascular system all the veins and arteries in our body making miracles of logistics every day
14496, 0 ### i don't know if you realize but each of us has miles of blood vessels in our bodies miles
14497, 0 ### if our surface grid is saturated well let's elevate our traffic
14499, 0 ### those drivers could all fit in one red bus
14501, 1 ### you get started maybe a little slowly but you get enough done in the first week that with some heavier days later on everything gets done things stay civil
14502, 1 ### i would have it all ready to go but then actually the paper would come along and then i would kind of do this
14503, 1 ### so we had an awesome new revised plan
14504, 0 ### this is how the year would go
14505, 0 ### we can visualize the future
14507, 0 ### he has nothing to wake up for so the effects of procrastination they're not contained they just extend outward forever
14508, 1 ### now i'm destined to spend a lot of time with some unique very very special individualistic and often seductive female characters
14509, 1 ### and of course one of the rules that we have in the vehicle is that he who drowns the vehicle gets to swim with the crocodiles
14510, 1 ### it was the only way for me to save the marriage because beverly felt she was being replaced you see
14511, 1 ### okay so she was a little bit rough
14512, 1 ### and well we can report in fact that we're grandparents
14513, 0 ### but one of the things that science really lets us down on is that personality that individual personality that these animals have
14515, 0 ### this particular one is called he who greets with fire and you can just see that about him you know that's his character
14516, 0 ### but we're really there seeking and searching and filming the cats
14517, 0 ### and we can only work that out as people were seeing parallels between the side of nature and gang warfare
14519, 1 ### and they can use that energy in case the wind falls away and the tide is coming up and there is still a little bit of energy to reach the dunes and save their lives because they are drowned very easily
14520, 1 ### so when the storm is coming up it drives a pin into the ground
14521, 0 ### theo jansen is working hard on this evolution
14522, 0 ### it works the same as a wheel
14523, 0 ### there's a guy pushing there behind but it can also walk on the wind very well
14524, 1 ### having your body laid out to be eaten by animals is not for everyone
14526, 1 ### i'm decomposing under here
14527, 0 ### and i have some good news if you're looking to avoid the whole doomed to decay and die thing you will have all the help in the world in that avoidance from the funeral industry
14528, 0 ### so let's return to the idea of protection sanitation and
14530, 1 ### i think i'll lighten up a little
14538, 1 ### i walk during the day and i follow people who i think look interesting
14539, 1 ### so i do it
14541, 1 ### and there were times when i was actually so desperate i would just you know walk into a room and just go like eric and anybody who would turn around i would sort of make a for
14542, 1 ### they eat out they see shows
14543, 1 ### it's just that
14544, 1 ### and if you're not you have to pretend to be slightly bored with everything
14545, 0 ### because i feel like you know there are so many images out there so many clothes out there
14546, 0 ### it does not come for me from research
14548, 0 ### and anyway roll this little clip i'll just show you
14549, 0 ### it's rarely color that i find in nature although you know juxtaposed next to artificial color natural color is so beautiful
14550, 0 ### we can do anything you ask
14551, 0 ### and we you know sort of introduced them to each other
14553, 1 ### thank goodness i can't be spock
14554, 0 ### i told myself yes i will be the ultimate team player
14557, 1 ### now just knowing that word the cloud has been transformational in my research group because students come to me and say uri i'm in the cloud and i say great you must be feeling miserable
14559, 0 ### and i started thinking maybe there's a pattern here
14560, 1 ### they started dreaming about the decorations invitations the dresses they were going to wear and what their fathers could and could not wear
14561, 1 ### they acted sweet
14565, 0 ### fathers were in a space where they were able to make their daughters play and pull out her chair and extend his hand for a dance
14571, 1 ### so it's got some errors but at least it counts up
14574, 0 ### they're cell oriented
14577, 1 ### after having worked in afghanistan for over six years now a lot of my family and friends think that what i do looks like this
14579, 0 ### and if you watched afghanistan on the news you may have this view that it's a failed state
14582, 1 ### because when i decided to go into advertising i wanted to do i wanted to naked people on ice for whiskey commercials that's what i really wanted to do
14585, 0 ### see for instance in this picture
14587, 0 ### my first job in brazil was actually to develop a way to improve the readability of billboards and based on speed angle of approach and actually blocks of text
14589, 0 ### the teapot
14592, 1 ### as an aside those of you who remember dan aykroyd in the doing julia child imitations can see where he got the idea of stabbing himself from this fabulous slide
14596, 1 ### this kind of cooking drove me to learn how to cook for myself
14598, 0 ### it's a holocaust of a different kind and hiding under our desks isn't going to help
14599, 0 ### livestock is also one of the biggest culprits in land degradation air and water pollution water shortages and loss of biodiversity
14601, 0 ### we were told we were assured that the more meat and dairy and poultry we ate the healthier we'd be
14603, 0 ### we're not born craving whoppers or skittles
14605, 0 ### and guess what half the people who developed the food pyramid have ties to agribusiness
14606, 1 ### now i'm here on the green side down on the far right where the geeks are and also is down on the far right
14607, 0 ### let's take a look at san francisco
14608, 1 ### maybe this is what it's like to be on the other side of
14609, 0 ### i was a student at harvard and i loved to travel
14610, 1 ### and it got to the point where every time i walked up to a table that had a kid anywhere between three and years old i was ready to fight
14611, 1 ### are you a boy or are you a girl familiar silence but this time i'm ready and i am about to go all women's studies on this table
14613, 1 ### one of my most memorable grenade tosses was at my sister's wedding
14614, 1 ### and then one woman stumped but wanting so desperately to show her support to let me know she was on my side she finally blurted out well sometimes my husband wears pink shirts
14615, 1 ### do not give them that sense of false hope
14616, 0 ### several years ago i was working at the south side walnut cafe a local diner in town and during my time there i would go through phases of militant lesbian intensity not shaving my armpits quoting difranco lyrics as gospel
14617, 0 ### and why because pancake girl and i we were both real with each other
14622, 1 ### months later she was joking that her husband had threatened to pull her out of the classes as he found out that his now literate wife was going through his phone text messages
14623, 0 ### as i started this work it was not always easy to convince the women to participate
14624, 1 ### yeah
14625, 0 ### oh and that's not even the tip of the iceberg
14626, 1 ### i call it tablet on a stick
14627, 1 ### because people these days they make friends they chat gossip and flirt from the comfort of their sofa
14629, 1 ### by now you're probably thinking of all the advantages of country living
14630, 1 ### six years ago my wife and i we packed our stuff we sold our little apartment in spain and for the same money we bought a house with a garden and little birds that come singing in the morning
14631, 1 ### and now we'll make sure to have a good spot for drones to land
14632, 1 ### i'm not
14636, 0 ### it's a lot of fun sometimes
14637, 0 ### more jobs and career opportunities
14638, 0 ### but even though most people would want to current technology makes the experience isolating
14639, 0 ### but with advances in augmented reality it will be easy to wrap the robot in a nice hologram that actually looks and moves like a person
14640, 0 ### but today you can do all that online
14641, 0 ### that's more expensive
14642, 1 ### like he said we're three brothers from new jersey you know the bluegrass capital of the world
14643, 0 ### we can't really figure out the reason
14644, 1 ### but maybe if i cut a hole in his head i can fix it
14645, 1 ### and they came back to their american clinic and they said they had learned it was as important to wash your hands before doing surgery as it was to wash up afterwards
14646, 0 ### so a little bit of perspective about years of perspective
14647, 0 ### we really are seeing the dawn of surgery
14648, 1 ### but it didn't work out
14649, 1 ### and this is one of the early music videos that i made music touch the sky by west you may notice some slight similarities here
14651, 1 ### and this is actually someone dancing about architecture in virtual reality
14653, 0 ### i felt so connected to this world
14654, 0 ### and we've done incredible things with those rectangles
14655, 0 ### it's a website
14656, 1 ### basically i use my mouth in strange ways in exchange for cash
14657, 1 ### that's good
14658, 1 ### party party yeah
14659, 1 ### for example the one on the left here allows me to add a little bit of reverb to my sound which gives me that flavor
14660, 0 ### if you guys haven't figured it out already my name's tom thum and i'm a which means all the sounds that you just heard were made entirely using just my voice and the only thing was my voice
14661, 0 ### because it is a bit of a niche market and there's not much work going on especially where i'm from
14662, 0 ### all right boys take it away
14663, 0 ### thank you
14664, 1 ### and given average demographics i think what that means is most of the people who saw me on that show are now dead
14665, 1 ### if nothing else you realize very quickly as a teenager it is not a hit with girls to know captain kirk's middle name
14666, 1 ### and i know how deeply annoying it is so karma does work
14667, 1 ### it's the most fun you can have with your pants on
14668, 1 ### yes i will come destroy the computer and defend my species
14669, 1 ### this is what it looks like when the future comes for you
14670, 1 ### that's just annoying
14671, 0 ### and we lived overseas we lived in south korea where my dad was working where there was only one english language tv channel
14672, 0 ### and you think ah hah knowledge really is power the right fact deployed at exactly the right place
14674, 0 ### the third reason i said yes is because i was pretty confident that i was going to win
14675, 0 ### there was no software that could compete at this kind of arena
14676, 0 ### we got to walk through his climate controlled server room
14677, 0 ### like you're going to play the chicago bulls and there's the thing in the middle of their court
14678, 1 ### that's that girl who wrote that book based on that movie
14679, 0 ### in other words i had to find a way to make sure that my creativity survived its own success
14681, 1 ### and i've always thought it a shame that these giant plant eating dinosaurs are too often portrayed as passive lumbering platters of meat on the landscape
14682, 0 ### first find rocks of the right age
14684, 1 ### in case you are wondering no i'm not wearing a dress and no i'm not saying what i'm wearing underneath
14685, 1 ### like our women we men get to wear pretty bright colors but unlike our women we get to show off our legs
14686, 1 ### my country is not one big monastery populated with happy monks
14688, 1 ### here's a fun fact you're looking at the world's biggest pocket
14689, 1 ### in this pocket we store all manner of personal goods from phones and wallets to office files and books
14690, 0 ### we call this holistic approach to development gross national happiness or
14691, 0 ### medical consultation medical treatment medicines they are all provided by the state
14693, 0 ### turns out it's a big deal
14694, 0 ### so inside our country we are a net carbon sink
14695, 0 ### it's stunning
14696, 1 ### and so for many years i feared that my father would die before i had a chance to kill him
14698, 1 ### when came to this country from jamaica in the early he insisted on wearing light summer suits no matter the weather and in the course of researching their lives i asked my mom whatever became of and she said he caught a cold and died
14699, 1 ### but when i am working in my house and writing after a day's writing i rush downstairs and i'm very excited to talk about marcus garvey or bob marley and words are tripping out of my mouth like butterflies and i'm so excited that my children stop me and they say dad nobody cares
14700, 0 ### maybe it's a migrant lesson
14701, 0 ### you are being watched
14702, 0 ### if you have seen some of the images of the caribbean people arriving in the and you might have noticed that a lot of the men wear
14703, 0 ### but in conjuring his life it was okay and very straightforward to portray a caribbean life in england in the with bowls of plastic fruit polystyrene ceiling tiles permanently sheathed in their transparent covers that they were delivered in
14705, 1 ### that makes me worry a little bit
14706, 0 ### but i'm not just doing this to be cute
14708, 1 ### and finally in german of course in german they have a word called which is the dread of getting what you want
14709, 1 ### i don't have a word for that yet but i will
14710, 1 ### the way that this path is real because people wanted it to be there
14711, 1 ### it's called a desire path
14712, 1 ### the problem with that is no one seems to know what those two letters stand for
14713, 0 ### and the whole mission of the project is to find holes in the language of emotion and try to fill them so that we have a way of talking about all those human and quirks of the human condition that we all feel but may not think to talk about because we don't have the words to do it
14714, 0 ### but once you realize that people that this world was built by people no smarter than you then you can reach out and touch those walls and even put your hand through them and realize that you have the power to change it
14715, 0 ### a million brains ok now we're talking
14716, 0 ### and i think when we're all searching for meaning in our lives and searching for the meaning of life i think words have something to do with that
14717, 0 ### it's not just my words
14718, 1 ### i actually wrote hopefully for the last time in public ever
14719, 1 ### i love the little smile she does right over the top of the note like no problem everything's fine
14720, 0 ### they wouldn't have me
14721, 0 ### it sounds great
14722, 1 ### and so i want to simulate fog and that's why i brought a handkerchief with me
14723, 0 ### this means we need to use existing infrastructure as much as possible
14725, 1 ### i was with my brother and a mate having a few beers and i was watching the world go by had a few more beers and the conversation turned to fashion and how everything manages to come back into style
14729, 0 ### and we sort of all choked up in the back of the taxi and i didn't tell him who i was because i didn't think it was appropriate and i just shook his hand and i said thank you so much
14730, 0 ### we fund prostate cancer foundations now in countries
14732, 1 ### this is me at an early age with a baby chimpanzee
14733, 1 ### i'm not sure how well the chimpanzees read it but they surely seemed interested in the book
14734, 1 ### so one of the two is not really interested in the task anymore
14735, 1 ### now look at what happens at the very end of this
14737, 1 ### so it's what we call
14738, 1 ### they developed several of these alternative techniques that we did not approve of necessarily
14739, 1 ### now look at the other it doesn't forget to eat of course
14740, 1 ### and there's a chimpanzee watching an actual real chimpanzee watching a computer screen on which we play these animations
14742, 1 ### and if the partner puts pressure on them so if the partner starts spitting water and intimidating them then the choices go down
14743, 1 ### she gives a rock to us now gets again cucumber
14744, 1 ### and she gets cucumber again
14745, 1 ### so this is basically the wall street protest that you see here
14746, 1 ### and so one philosopher even wrote us that it was impossible that monkeys had a sense of fairness because fairness was invented during the french revolution
14747, 0 ### the only thing that matters is that you win or you lose
14748, 0 ### the principle is that you have a valuable relationship that is damaged by conflict so you need to do something about it
14749, 0 ### and it's really unfair to humanity because humanity is actually much more cooperative and than given credit for
14750, 0 ### and human morality is more than this but if you would remove these two pillars there would be not much remaining i think
14751, 0 ### otherwise they wouldn't be pulling so hard
14752, 0 ### there's actually a lot of evidence in primates and other animals that they return favors
14753, 0 ### and so what we did in that case we do these studies in thailand for josh is we have an apparatus around which there is a rope a single rope
14754, 0 ### so it's actually fairly simple for them
14755, 0 ### and the emotional part
14756, 0 ### very few animals i think elephants and apes can do that kind of thing
14759, 0 ### then the next one is the pro social token
14760, 0 ### and there are now many more because after we did this about years ago it became very well known
14761, 0 ### we take them out of the group put them in a test chamber
14762, 1 ### it's a bit odd
14763, 1 ### let's just say it's a bit chilly
14767, 0 ### i'm actually just a survivor and these photographs that i'm showing you here are dangerous
14770, 0 ### i became very low
14771, 0 ### i feel so lucky and i've been times in my life and all those people who come with us return home as great champions not only for antarctica but for local issues back in their own nations
14772, 1 ### that's about the percentage of the american public that believes the moon landing was a fake
14773, 1 ### and if you want proof let's start where most conversations in the us seem to start with kim kardashian
14774, 0 ### suddenly my family was thrown into the middle of a nightmare being told that my brother was going to die actually being given the opportunity to say goodbye to him then several emergency brain surgeries and now what's amounted for matt to a lifetime spent courageously recovering from a traumatic brain injury
14775, 0 ### only instead of doing it to sell products doing it to save lives
14776, 1 ### it makes for an exotic and chilly commute
14777, 0 ### it records the annual rise and fall of greenhouse gases and temperatures going back before the onset of the last ice ages
14778, 1 ### they can connect us to our deepest humanity or with people we'll never meet
14779, 1 ### i used to work with a bunch of uptight religious people so sometimes i didn't wear panties and just had a big smile and chuckled to myself
14780, 1 ### we all heard you pee
14782, 1 ### he pays me a lot to keep it a secret
14784, 1 ### and he emailed me this picture
14786, 0 ### you can see my wife struggling to stack a brick of postcards on a pyramid of over a half million secrets
14787, 0 ### and he said frank i've got to share with you this story that just played out in my life
14789, 0 ### thank you for making your site
14790, 0 ### when i posted this secret dozens of people sent voicemail messages from their phones sometimes ones they'd been keeping for years messages from family or friends who had died
14791, 0 ### thank you
14792, 1 ### and finally let's see this is a totally different interaction and i think you have to imagine that there's this giant invisible drum sitting right here on stage and i'm going to bang it
14794, 0 ### that's usually followed by a second thought which is whatever it is that i'm doing i love it
14795, 0 ### by the way i'm just going to nerd out for just a few minutes here so i would say don't freak out
14798, 1 ### he doesn't know that what we're feeding is real time data from the stock market and he's making buy and sell decisions
14799, 1 ### so we'll report on that later to see how well this goes
14800, 1 ### here's another thing we're doing during the talks this morning we've been automatically scraping for the and we've been doing an automated sentiment analysis which means are people using positive words or negative words or neutral and while this has been going on i have been feeling this and so i am plugged in to the aggregate emotion of thousands of people in real time and that's a new kind of human experience because now i can know how everyone's doing and how much you're loving this
14801, 1 ### it's like a massage
14802, 0 ### but we're not seeing all the waves out there
14803, 0 ### now what this means is that our experience of reality is constrained by our biology and that goes against the common sense notion that our eyes and our ears and our fingertips are just picking up the objective reality that's out there
14806, 0 ### your brain is locked in a vault of silence and darkness inside your skull
14807, 0 ### so i call this the p
14808, 1 ### and i give them access to me every single day which is why they all have my personal cell number including my scholars and those who graduated which is probably why i get phone calls and text messages at three o'clock in the morning
14809, 0 ### eighty six percent of them were below grade level in english and in math
14810, 1 ### no i don't
14811, 1 ### it's a completely solution apart from the fact that teddy's probably not loving it
14812, 0 ### and that's what i want to talk about today
14813, 0 ### we were asked by a large healthcare system in minnesota to describe to them what their patient experience was
14814, 1 ### you get some sense of the size you can just see these standard size people underneath
14815, 1 ### relative to the universe it's just up the road
14816, 1 ### now i don't think he meant to insult the rest of science although he was from new zealand so it's possible
14817, 1 ### this is it
14820, 0 ### and again a standard size real person so you get some sense of the scale
14821, 0 ### yeah it's a wonderful achievement
14823, 0 ### back at the start in the first billionth of a second we believe or we've observed it was very simple
14824, 1 ### so i couldn't wait to get started to work on this so i could introduce kevin to my robot
14825, 1 ### but that wasn't the kind of robot my dad had in mind
14827, 1 ### that's what i do
14828, 1 ### so he loved the concept and when the tele actor walked onstage she walked right up to him and she gave him a big kiss right on the lips
14829, 1 ### she said when she was just about to walk onstage the tele directors still were trying to agree on what to do and so she just walked onstage and did what felt most natural
14830, 1 ### and so that project taught me another lesson about life which is that when in doubt improvise
14831, 1 ### maybe it runs in the family
14832, 0 ### and a few years later he was diagnosed with cancer
14833, 0 ### when i was at college i decided to study engineering like him
14834, 0 ### so rather than have it fight or do industrial work we decided to build a planter put the robot into the center of it and we called it the
14835, 0 ### that robot was operated by more people than any other robot in history
14836, 0 ### and when i got here i looked up hubert dreyfus who's a world renowned professor of philosophy and i talked with him about this and he said this is one of the oldest and most central problems in philosophy
14837, 0 ### so we got a chance to take the tele actor to the awards in san francisco
14838, 0 ### and as a result the needles damage these organs cause damage which leads to trauma and side effects
14839, 0 ### and the last project also has to do with medical robotics
14842, 1 ### and for those of you who haven't seen denial spoiler alert we won
14843, 1 ### not small things many of us in this audience write books are writing books we always make mistakes that's why we're glad to have second editions correct the mistakes
14844, 1 ### elvis is not alive
14846, 0 ### but above all who would have to be wrong the perpetrators
14847, 0 ### think about it
14849, 0 ### but when i looked at them i didn't see any like uniforms swastika like symbols on the wall sieg heil salutes none of that
14850, 1 ### because a couple years after brazil was awarded the world cup we heard that the brazilian government wanted to do something meaningful in the opening ceremony in the country that reinvented and perfected soccer until we met the germans of course
14851, 1 ### flight control is brazilian
14852, 1 ### we're just scientists
14853, 0 ### he's a para athlete right now
14854, 0 ### and a brain machine interface is not rocket science it's just brain research
14855, 0 ### and to get a reward a drop of orange juice that monkeys love this animal has to detect select one of these objects by touching not by seeing it by touching it because every time this virtual hand touches one of the objects an electrical pulse goes back to the brain of the animal describing the fine texture of the surface of this object so the animal can judge what is the correct object that he has to grab and if he does that he gets a reward without moving a muscle
14856, 1 ### never mind that this is what you'll actually produce if you attempt to work at a computer with a baby on your lap
14857, 1 ### i'm just going to show you two of them
14858, 1 ### i don't really know what's going on in this picture because i find it weird and slightly creepy
14859, 0 ### just put the term working mother into any image search engine stock photo site
14860, 0 ### i wanted to make a point
14861, 0 ### a male coworker was annoyed that i had been out on so he intentionally opened the door on me while i was pumping breast milk and stood in the doorway with inmates in the hallway
14862, 1 ### it was the brutal realization the first morning that the indian students were better than me
14863, 1 ### in sweden we read it once and then we went partying
14864, 1 ### and they were the first to
14865, 1 ### look there united states
14867, 1 ### now a historian tells me it's even more difficult to predict about the past
14868, 1 ### the of july is my birthday
14869, 0 ### and i will now here onstage try to predict when that will happen that asia will regain its dominant position as the leading part of the world as it used to be over thousands of years
14870, 0 ### was the year when the courageous uprising against the foreign occupation of india was defeated by the british forces
14871, 0 ### and let's see how much difference that can make
14873, 0 ### and you can see that the countries who were growing their economy was united states and united kingdom
14874, 0 ### health is getting better united kingdom united states
14875, 0 ### not much has happened
14876, 1 ### now people recognize me in macy's and my grandchildren think that i'm cool
14877, 1 ### actually i wasn't even sure that i could go around the stadium without a walker
14880, 1 ### nice people with common sense do not make interesting characters
14881, 1 ### i looked like a refrigerator
14882, 1 ### my back is always straight and i don't make old people's noises
14883, 1 ### no grunting no coughing no wheezing no talking to yourselves no
14884, 1 ### sophia loren was right in front of me she's a foot taller than i am not counting the hair
14885, 1 ### that was fortunate for me because in most press photos i appear too although often between legs
14887, 1 ### no wonder that by age five i was a raging feminist although the term had not reached chile yet so nobody knew what the heck was wrong with me
14888, 1 ### but i was happy to pay it because for every blow that i received i was able to deliver two
14889, 1 ### feminism has never been sexy but let me assure you that it never stopped me from flirting and i have seldom suffered from lack of men
14891, 0 ### only a fearless and determined heart will get the gold medal
14892, 0 ### when she was years old her grandfather sold her to a brothel
14893, 0 ### we can call this place in congo a death camp because those who are not killed will die of disease or starvation
14894, 0 ### she names the twins after the camp's commanders to gain their favor and feeds them with black tea because her milk cannot sustain them
14896, 0 ### she risks a lot and she's terrified
14897, 0 ### the woman's face looks like a watermelon
14898, 0 ### although women do two thirds of the world's labor they own less than one percent of the world's assets
14899, 0 ### she gets the women to plant new trees and water them drop by drop
14900, 0 ### i can promise you that women working together linked informed and educated can bring peace and prosperity to this forsaken planet
14902, 0 ### in our species the alpha males define reality and force the rest of the pack to accept that reality and follow the rules
14903, 0 ### look around in this room all this knowledge energy talent and technology
14904, 1 ### and so i tap back fu
14905, 1 ### and i said fu as in i finally understand
14906, 0 ### these things occurred in my life in a way that was surprising especially to me
14907, 0 ### throughout this ordeal no one hugged me no one counseled me no one told me i would be okay
14908, 1 ### but actually i had to go around the world in a balloon to be invited to talk about it
14909, 1 ### and he told me yes but with the low pressure you have on your left if you fly too fast in a couple of hours you will turn left and end up at the north pole
14911, 1 ### if you tell to people we want to be independent from fossil energy in our world people will laugh at you except here where crazy people are invited to speak
14912, 1 ### and there there will be just one goal just one reach the next sunrise before the batteries are empty
14913, 0 ### and i think that's one of the main problems of our society
14914, 0 ### we want to go in a direction but the winds push us in another direction like in life
14916, 0 ### it's not true
14917, 0 ### no
14918, 1 ### to poke fun at their stereotypes nigeria would be outside explaining that he will pay the entrance fee all he needs is the account details
14920, 1 ### because at that time if you were to search africa on or on or any kind of social media you would think that the entire continent was just pictures of animals and white guys drinking cocktails in hotel resorts
14922, 0 ### so i sent out a few other about my own country and a few other african countries i'm familiar with
14925, 0 ### but it would go on to have a very peculiar effect on me
14926, 1 ### i do now after learning about all the quantum stuff
14927, 1 ### no it's a little robot on heroin or something i think
14928, 1 ### i have three girls and they just they it's like a rescue animal thing they're going there
14930, 1 ### hey
14932, 1 ### you can make him bipolar or as someone said a you can change his homeostatic drives or whatever you want to call them
14934, 0 ### pass
14935, 0 ### then this is a maker i think
14936, 0 ### next is a compilation of a bunch of stuff
14938, 0 ### this is a we're doing some flight testing on my little seeing if this can really grab
14939, 0 ### and then i made a lego animator
14940, 0 ### i used to be in the film business kind of and actually nicholas saw this when i was like and anyway so then they said no you have to make two and they have to fight
14942, 1 ### intimacy means physical emotional connection with somebody else and especially with somebody of the opposite sex who gives off ambiguous contradictory signals
14943, 1 ### and there's some guy watching a hundred obviously
14944, 1 ### it's your job to solve
14945, 0 ### boys are percent more likely than girls to drop out of school
14946, 0 ### they don't know what to say they don't know what to do especially one with the opposite sex
14948, 1 ### that's older than my dad
14949, 1 ### however undeterred due to my teenage optimism i went online to a teenager's two best friends and
14950, 0 ### essentially i could weave a bunch of these antibodies into a network of carbon such that you have a network that only reacts with one protein but also due to the properties of these it will change its electrical properties based on the amount of protein present
14952, 1 ### i turned to my mom and dad to tell them we needed to go home and at that moment you came out of the student union building wearing the stupidest hat i've ever seen in my life

15397, 0 ### i think this tree is going to be bad news for bigots because they're going to have to realize that they are cousins with thousands of people in whatever ethnic group they happen to have issues with and i think you look back at history and a lot of the terrible things we've done to each other is because one group thinks another group is sub human and you can't do that anymore
15398, 1 ### and that was largely because there weren't any
15399, 0 ### so that when it gets dark i've got plenty of power
15400, 1 ### all right now
15401, 1 ### lots of laughter quite a bit of embarrassment
15402, 1 ### he got exactly the same response lots and lots of
15403, 1 ### i wanted to there we go
15406, 1 ### so the rest of you can save them for when i say something particularly boring and then you can fire at me
15407, 1 ### so ah that was fun
15408, 1 ### well not necessarily
15409, 1 ### because when we looked at the video when he got back we saw minutes of this
15410, 0 ### you all have a piece of cardboard and a piece of paper
15411, 0 ### but as they learn to become adults they become much more sensitive to the opinions of others and they lose that freedom and they do start to become embarrassed
15412, 0 ### he knew that friendship is a short cut to play
15413, 0 ### or even in the swiss office of which perhaps has the most wacky ideas of all
15414, 0 ### its a toy its called a finger blaster
15415, 0 ### and im going to run a little experiment
15418, 0 ### and a reason for that we want to settle on an answer
15419, 0 ### and this openness is the beginning of exploratory play
15422, 1 ### and no problem but unfortunately continuing with the scientific examination of this painting came out that rafael did not paint the unicorn did not paint the puppy dog actually left the painting unfinished so all this writing about the exotic symbol of the unicorn unfortunately is not very reliable
15423, 1 ### you see the geniality of his creation right directly on the ground layer of the panel and see this cool thing finding i should rather say an elephant
15424, 0 ### these are the original windows of the hall of the sala grande
15425, 0 ### many political reasons
15426, 1 ### note the textbook the sage on the stage and the sleeping guy in the back
15427, 1 ### we were thrilled to have that kind of audience and just a bit terrified that we hadn't finished preparing the class yet
15428, 1 ### but if you can do it any time that means you can do it tomorrow and if you can do it tomorrow well you may not ever get around to it
15429, 1 ### so we brought back the innovation of having due dates
15430, 0 ### and that's exactly what we were aiming for
15431, 0 ### we mostly avoid questions like here's a formula now tell me the value of y when x is equal to two
15432, 0 ### sebastian and i have forgotten some of that
15434, 1 ### as though she's a southern waitress
15436, 1 ### or maybe it's called being a workaholic
15438, 1 ### nothing out of the ordinary
15439, 1 ### all that exists are sticky fingers and gooey kisses and tiny voices and crayons and that song about letting go of whatever it is that frozen girl needs to let go of
15440, 1 ### i've got issues
15442, 1 ### your child does not think you're that interesting
15443, 1 ### if i'm not a ladybug or a piece of candy i'm invisible after minutes
15444, 1 ### and my old if i can get a old to talk to me for minutes i'm parent of the year
15445, 0 ### did i want to be on live tv no but yes
15446, 0 ### and it's had a magical effect on me on my children on our family
15447, 0 ### no
15449, 0 ### in america my television shows are back to back to back on thursday night
15451, 0 ### for me my work is at all times building a nation out of thin air
15452, 0 ### i love working
15454, 0 ### i just know that i want to tell you i'm a titan and i know that i don't want to question it
15455, 0 ### i love that hum
15456, 1 ### it's cold it's eerie it's misty it might be raining and you might be standing on the shores of lake michigan brimming with paint thinner
15458, 1 ### so this is the picture you would have at the window of airlines as you fly across the surface of titan
15460, 0 ### and we have been to saturn before we visited saturn in the early but our investigations of saturn have become far more in depth in detail since the cassini spacecraft traveling across interplanetary space for seven years glided into orbit around saturn in the summer of and became at that point the farthest robotic outpost that humanity had ever established around the sun
15463, 0 ### this haze is ubiquitous
15464, 1 ### for example in polite requests if someone says if you could pass the guacamole that would be awesome we know exactly what he means even though that's a rather bizarre concept being expressed
15465, 1 ### it would be a real shame if something happened to it we understand that as a veiled threat rather than a musing of hypothetical possibilities
15466, 0 ### now this is one model of how language comes to be namely it's legislated by an academy
15467, 0 ### let me start off with a technical problem in language that i've worried about for quite some time and indulge me in my passion for verbs and how they're used
15470, 1 ### now picture yourself in a driverless car in the year sitting back and watching this vintage video
15474, 1 ### when we asked people whether they would purchase such cars they said absolutely not
15475, 1 ### they would like to buy cars that protect them at all costs but they want everybody else to buy cars that minimize harm
15476, 1 ### so to use the sheep metaphor it's like we now have electric sheep that have a mind of their own
15477, 0 ### now the way we think about this problem matters
15479, 0 ### says the car should follow utilitarian ethics it should take the action that will minimize total harm even if that action will kill a bystander and even if that action will kill the passenger
15480, 0 ### now if each farmer brings a certain number of sheep let's say three sheep the land will be rejuvenated the farmers are happy the sheep are happy everything is good
15482, 0 ### and we vary the ages and even the species of the different victims
15483, 0 ### in the isaac asimov wrote his famous laws of robotics the three laws of robotics
15489, 1 ### because your companies will always take away your life but they can never take away your vacation in theory
15490, 1 ### so i went and bought khaki shorts or whatever and unfortunately their branding was all about keep it simple
15491, 1 ### it's not very simple a little bit confusing
15493, 1 ### so i'm mostly driving along okay and then i saw this sign
15494, 1 ### modernism means white box and it's a perfect white box
15495, 1 ### and this also happened so i have five daughters now
15496, 1 ### school was great and maybe going to school helped me get to this media lab place i'm not sure
15497, 1 ### eye candy sort of pejorative don't you think so i say no i make eye meat instead
15498, 1 ### what if i make like a car crash test so i have a crash test
15500, 1 ### paint is a very simple way to paint with
15502, 1 ### end of story
15503, 1 ### it doesn't make any sense
15504, 1 ### as you age from infant age your vision gets better and maybe in your late teens early twenties you're looking for a mate and your vision goes after that
15505, 0 ### it's kind of a book about questions questions about simplicity
15507, 0 ### it's a very simple kind of food
15508, 0 ### this amazing person muriel cooper
15510, 0 ### when you have mentors and yesterday kareem abdul jabbar talked about mentors these people in your life the problem with mentors is that they all die
15511, 0 ### and because of that i always wondered about this human thing
15512, 0 ### now humans are catching up
15513, 0 ### i spent my entire early career making complex stuff
15514, 0 ### i did this series of calendars for shiseido
15515, 0 ### and so i made a lot of these types of things
15516, 0 ### so to get off the tree i began to use my old computers
15518, 0 ### it's sort of a midwest cornfield out of french fries
15519, 0 ### it's a very short simple book
15520, 0 ### the three keys are easy to eat so this is cooked already so easy to eat
15521, 0 ### they want the big cookie
15523, 1 ### you've got to shine blue light on the kid
15524, 1 ### ok we'll figure that out
15525, 1 ### if you try to put more than one kid in you're stacking them on top of each other
15526, 1 ### last story here i've got a friend in india who told me that you haven't really tested a piece of electronic technology for distribution in asia until you've trained a cockroach to climb in and pee on every single little component on the inside
15527, 1 ### those poor ants
15528, 0 ### so this is a newborn intensive care unit in nepal
15529, 0 ### keeping a baby warm for a week that's not rocket science
15530, 0 ### so the idea here is unlike the concept car we want to marry something beautiful with something that actually works
15531, 0 ### we wanted to make beautiful things that are going to make the world a better place and i don't think this kid was even in it long enough to get warm
15533, 0 ### those decisions are made by the ministry of health or by foreign donors and it just kind of shows up
15534, 1 ### he'd spent dollars to buy a website that exclusively featured women having sex on top of or inside of luxury sports cars
15535, 0 ### it's a lot harder than you might think
15537, 1 ### dad wasn't a real militaristic kind of guy he just felt bad that he wasn't able to fight in world war on account of his handicap although they did let him get through the several army physical exam before they got to the very last test which was for vision
15539, 1 ### which incidentally makes me the opposite of dean kamen because i'm a comic book artist son of an inventor and he's an inventor son of a comic book artist
15542, 1 ### in that sense yes
15543, 1 ### the distance from abraham lincoln to a lincoln penny to penny marshall to the marshall plan to plan to nine lives it's all the same
15547, 0 ### now this gives a real meaning to the term blind faith which doesn't have the same negative connotation for me that it does for other people
15548, 0 ### now we've seen a lot of examples of people who are pursuing that sort of vision in science but i think it's also true in the arts it's true in politics it's even true in personal endeavors
15549, 0 ### these are four very different ways of looking at the world
15555, 0 ### what i'm searching for is a durable mutation that's what all of us are searching for
15556, 1 ### this is amazing
15557, 1 ### what would you say to people who think that dick cheney's really something else
15558, 1 ### i can see you
15559, 1 ### the wiretap on your line got a little interfered with for a moment
15560, 1 ### it's a lot warmer
15561, 0 ### but when i think about it this isn't the question that we should be struggling with
15562, 0 ### i wouldn't use patriot and i wouldn't use traitor
15563, 0 ### but there are also things that go too far
15564, 0 ### we've never seen any evidence of even a single instance of specific harm and because of that i'm comfortable with the decisions that i made
15565, 0 ### that allows sort of a warrantless wiretapping mass surveillance of the entire country's phone records things like that who you're talking to when you're talking to them where you traveled
15566, 1 ### it's fine
15567, 1 ### they almost never do more than that
15568, 1 ### it's okay you want to pay billion dollars for dark urine i'm totally with you
15569, 1 ### so we run away from it and where do we run we leap into the arms of big placebo
15570, 1 ### there wasn't any cantaloupe
15571, 1 ### so after this amazingly fun conversation you might want to say so you still want to get in this ridiculous time machine and go forward absolutely
15572, 0 ### i don't know
15573, 0 ### it's because possibilities on this planet they don't go back they go forward
15574, 0 ### so there better be a nine at the beginning of my death number
15575, 0 ### it reshaped the demography of the globe in a way that no war ever has
15577, 0 ### potable water arable land rainforests oil gas they're going away and they're going away soon and unless we innovate our way out of this mess we're going away too
15579, 1 ### they've been a problem for me since as far back as i can remember first when i was just a little baby tomboy and then later as a masculine appearing predominantly estrogen based organism
15580, 1 ### i've been stared at screamed at whispered about and one time i got smacked in the face by a little old lady's purse that from the looks of the shiner i took home that day i am pretty certain contained at least dollars of rolled up small change and a large hard candy collection
15581, 1 ### she told me camouflage
15582, 1 ### i said yes i had but not for a really long time
15583, 1 ### right she doesn't need to know that i figure
15584, 0 ### and now we've got these politicians that keep trying to pass these bathroom bills
15585, 0 ### they don't make anyone safer
15586, 0 ### we need to just admit that they are really only open for people who fit neatly into one of two gender boxes which i do not
15587, 0 ### her and her classmates were four years old
15588, 0 ### she seemed to take some comfort in that
15591, 0 ### the comments began pouring in and would collate them
15593, 1 ### it's incredible
15594, 0 ### postwar kosovo was a very interesting place because nato troops were there mostly to make sure the war didn't break out again
15595, 0 ### questions about security when you don't have any security systems are terrifying
15596, 1 ### i had absolutely no idea what she meant
15597, 1 ### why invite men they are the problem
15598, 1 ### we heard from a man out of zimbabwe who after hearing about created a husband school
15599, 0 ### you see in the village we were all equal
15600, 0 ### i felt guilty
15601, 0 ### we all feel the same things
15605, 1 ### i love to figure things out but the end result of what i'm doing is really completely ambiguous
15610, 0 ### when i'm making these pieces i'm always trying to find a point where i'm saying something very clearly and it's very simple but also at the same time it's very ambiguous
15612, 1 ### you can write papers about complexity and the nice thing about complexity is it's fundamentally intractable in many ways so you're not responsible for outcomes
15613, 1 ### one of the things i want to do is to help you with a very important task which you may not know that you have very often which is to understand how to sit next to a physicist at a dinner party and have a conversation
15615, 0 ### i want you to read this because we're going to come back to it in a moment
15616, 0 ### a coffee cup we don't think about coffee cups but it's much more interesting than one might think a coffee cup is a device which has a container and a handle
15618, 1 ### and my body had clearly changed and matt who was undeniably my nemesis in high school said in a booming voice that we no longer had to go far away to go on ski trips but we could all ski on mount
15619, 0 ### i tell that story because it has served and continues to serve as a metaphor to me about the level of that we all have on this earth
