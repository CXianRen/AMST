13850, FUNNY, ### oh sorry
5788, FUNNY, ### the one i liked the best is someone could download my sequence go back to the lab synthesize some fake ellen and plant it at a crime scene

13069, FUNNY, ### i lectured on this for ikea and they wanted to see the sofa immediately here
7906, NOTFUNNY, ### for example different climate models are largely able to capture the warming that we've seen so far

8231, NOTFUNNY, ### but that reality is expunged from our policy making process
11569, NOTFUNNY, ### this is a nice building
13549, NOTFUNNY, ### so we have an agreement
8180, NOTFUNNY, ### sri lanka still had the civil war going on so bali it was

1054, FUNNY, ### that was his idea of a performance enhancing drug
6718, FUNNY, ### it's fun
8556, FUNNY, ### and you know koran says that if you learn the holy book the woman they can be a good wife and they can obey their husband

1328, FUNNY, ### partly because they believe that scientists will be very cautious and responsible about using them
11642, NOTFUNNY, ### perhaps our parents suffered from depression
10440, FUNNY, ### in fact they're so well known that you might even recognize them in a slightly or somewhat different form
8966, FUNNY, ### and let's be honest at that point i was pretty excited too
7164, NOTFUNNY, ### so it's not exactly a stereotypical set of rules
12958, NOTFUNNY, ### i was trapped in a cage prey among predators fighting for freedom i never had
2212, NOTFUNNY, ### it's hard to believe but it's the truest thing i know

13537, FUNNY, ### pardon audience armani
7284, NOTFUNNY, ### we went down and investigated
5220, FUNNY, ### we didn't find a dinosaur
10828, FUNNY, ### so now students at the university of washington that are studying these crows do so with a giant wig and a big mask
1946, FUNNY, ### but as i said the military and the police are very different
13102, NOTFUNNY, ### so we were really excited about working with them
2330, FUNNY, ### now when you think of glass you might think of colorful designs or maybe italian vases but kids challenge glass artists to go beyond that into the realm of snakes and bacon boys who you can see has meat vision
15428, FUNNY, ### but if you can do it any time that means you can do it tomorrow and if you can do it tomorrow well you may not ever get around to it
853, NOTFUNNY, ### but out of all the bashing after a few months emerged the most fantastic music and i think there was just a miracle moment really derek when you realized that all the sounds you hear in the world out there is something that you can copy on the keyboard
12715, FUNNY, ### so anyway two years sort of passed and they had a child of their own and then another two years passed and they had another child of their own and then another time passed and they had another child that they called an accident which i thought was an unusual name
13394, FUNNY, ### when you're in the middle of the sea under a hundred foot crane trying to lower eight tons down to the sea floor you start to wonder whether i shouldn't have taken up watercolor painting instead
9678, NOTFUNNY, ### and that's ok right a lot of people are very happy with
12781, FUNNY, ### this is not mine by the way
9411, FUNNY, ### we call them bastards
11706, FUNNY, ### and then i saw this quote advertising is the price companies pay for being
3762, NOTFUNNY, ### she did this on the larry king live show on cnn six and a half years ago
4056, FUNNY, ### as you can see it has world class art and it's all my taste because i raised all the money
8370, FUNNY, ### and in fact to understand it i eventually had to create a whole new kind of science
11377, NOTFUNNY, ### i'm not done yet
394, FUNNY, ### because in her world you're either breeding or you're eating and i'm not breeding so
7554, NOTFUNNY, ### while he was doing this he noticed an unexpected thing
1020, NOTFUNNY, ### the original intent was to travel there and bring back a classic story of diverse species of an exotic locale
15228, FUNNY, ### so i went to the zoo and i asked the chimps
5676, NOTFUNNY, ### and we started with the stream and built the house along the stream dammed it up to make a lake
14952, FUNNY, ### i turned to my mom and dad to tell them we needed to go home and at that moment you came out of the student union building wearing the stupidest hat i've ever seen in my life
15376, FUNNY, ### colorization and sound effects added for you viewing pleasure
13063, NOTFUNNY, ### and so because of that belief that i think needs to be burst i'm here to send us all hurtling back to the truth
2163, NOTFUNNY, ### we can run the score up against anybody and then get our asses kicked in the second half what they call fourth generation warfare
1658, NOTFUNNY, ### seeing is believing
11933, NOTFUNNY, ### my parents were very up for me going
7410, FUNNY, ### they don't count on no dark knight with a stomach full of grocery store brand macaroni and cheese and cut up vienna sausages
14729, NOTFUNNY, ### and we sort of all choked up in the back of the taxi and i didn't tell him who i was because i didn't think it was appropriate and i just shook his hand and i said thank you so much
9603, FUNNY, ### so some of these things i'd wander around the streets of dakar asking people what's the algorithm what's the rule for making this and they'd say well we just make it that way because it looks pretty stupid
3933, FUNNY, ### we have chosen to avoid political debate and instead engage in dialogue in order to maintain what we fondly call our bipartisan friendship
6484, FUNNY, ### and they go oh billie they cannot focus
3745, FUNNY, ### you see these folks on television they never call anybody back from hell
13283, NOTFUNNY, ### we see mountains in the distance
894, NOTFUNNY, ### in the same way i look at the music i get a basic idea i wonder what technically might be hard or you know what i want to do
8155, FUNNY, ### she would get really really excited
8067, FUNNY, ### by the way this is the beginning of the asbestos lawsuit
8633, FUNNY, ### it has a space where you could have a bar mitzvah at the top
218, FUNNY, ### unfortunately though the site was separated from the river by mclean boulevard so i suggested let's reroute mclean and that gave birth instantly to friends of mclean boulevard
15430, NOTFUNNY, ### and that's exactly what we were aiming for
13756, FUNNY, ### i want to ask you now though to think maybe from your own experience or maybe just imagine it about the difference between the intensity of the experience under the wedding canopy and maybe the experience of the sixth or seventh anniversary
5116, FUNNY, ### i'm just doing what i can here
12612, NOTFUNNY, ### let's look at some data
12609, FUNNY, ### it got so bad that when he was asked what strategy he would use against a computer jan donner the dutch grandmaster replied i'd bring a hammer
8172, FUNNY, ### these are some pictures visitors sent to me
12542, NOTFUNNY, ### but the beauty is that is was installed by a priest a hindu priest who's only done eight years of primary schooling never been to school never been to college
13192, FUNNY, ### in the audience was asked to find a childhood photograph of themselves and restage it as an adult
10745, NOTFUNNY, ### you guys have heard of leveling up strength intelligence
10309, NOTFUNNY, ### you found an institution and you use the institution to coordinate the activities of the group
14258, NOTFUNNY, ### sometimes you get an extra one or drop one out but so you can skip the grandparent and great grandparent stage and go right to the great
3748, FUNNY, ### i just ingested six and a half days worth of sleeping pills
12362, FUNNY, ### so how is that being accomplished here if you stand on the apron of the wal mart over here and try to look at the target store over here you can't see it because of the curvature of the earth
2689, FUNNY, ### unlike bill gates i'm not going to release them
3816, NOTFUNNY, ### and it's important to know is a tonal language and so they'll say the word and same spelling one means sky or heaven and one means bicycle or iron
13844, FUNNY, ### and this is a small excerpt from a longer piece
9185, FUNNY, ### but i think a much bigger problem with this is that this logic that we should be dropping not bombs i mean it would make a fascinating title for thomas friedman's new book
9579, NOTFUNNY, ### it wasn't until later when i was actually back home in new york that i got the idea for the project
11645, FUNNY, ### so if anyone would like a hundred million copies of my business card i have plenty for everyone in the room and in fact everyone in the world and it's right here
5029, NOTFUNNY, ### we used an apple and it cost pennies
2682, NOTFUNNY, ### and i'm this morning going to talk about this for the first time
15431, NOTFUNNY, ### we mostly avoid questions like here's a formula now tell me the value of y when x is equal to two
5458, FUNNY, ### as a freelance journalist i sympathize
1051, NOTFUNNY, ### like a six if you flip it over it looks like a nine
5246, NOTFUNNY, ### we don't need any gratitude
15193, NOTFUNNY, ### i don't know the people who wrote all the books and articles that i read in preparation for this talk
10081, NOTFUNNY, ### it turns out by chance this dermatologist also trained in ophthalmology
12583, FUNNY, ### we'd find a bunch of fairly similar looking people
15209, NOTFUNNY, ### these guys were philosophers of mind
5107, NOTFUNNY, ### it's been a good run
11464, FUNNY, ### you can buy designer underwear that isn't really manufactured by a designer and even pirated evangelical
13298, NOTFUNNY, ### you know that's not a big deal to accomplish
705, NOTFUNNY, ### everyone knew everyone else's business even if they didn't want it to be known by anyone at all
15256, NOTFUNNY, ### unless you're on one of these californian low diets bread is standard
2953, NOTFUNNY, ### people still are dying in burkina faso and access to clean drinking water is still a big problem
9098, FUNNY, ### but if the chinese government intervenes it might even be a panda
4866, FUNNY, ### and then i just got on with it
10948, NOTFUNNY, ### a single child in front of a single computer will not do that
4202, FUNNY, ### and after i'm done cooking and cleaning and standing in line and getting stuck in traffic my partner and i we get together and we decide that we're gonna go and have some wild and crazy fun
14776, FUNNY, ### it makes for an exotic and chilly commute
6581, NOTFUNNY, ### and that connection is an unequivocally physical process
5569, FUNNY, ### the other interesting thing that i learned about whale sex they curl their toes too
9336, NOTFUNNY, ### where i couldn't stop looking
2140, FUNNY, ### a banana peel on the tarmac
10741, NOTFUNNY, ### good
5505, FUNNY, ### don't do that
14770, NOTFUNNY, ### i became very low
12380, NOTFUNNY, ### this was the winner of an international design award in i think something like that
11370, NOTFUNNY, ### and the global vote does exactly what it says on the tin
7291, FUNNY, ### that was not a controlled descent
13127, NOTFUNNY, ### and we started talking about music from bach to beethoven and brahms bruckner all the b's from all the way up to
14096, FUNNY, ### maybe he's worried that he's going bald
9979, NOTFUNNY, ### with this simple tweak the dance moves from being a dictation to a negotiation
2500, FUNNY, ### and that's how i became an an eclipse chaser
178, FUNNY, ### that would be like getting hungry at night and having to flip through the whole phone book from cover to cover pausing at every line just to find the nearest pizza joint
9747, NOTFUNNY, ### and i graduated high school without ever going to the cafeteria where i would have sat with the girls and been laughed at for doing so or sat with the boys and been laughed at for being a boy who should be sitting with the girls
1522, FUNNY, ### you didn't say that's a beautiful rainbow but it's kind of off to the left and if i could move it yards to the right it would be ever so much more beautiful
5591, FUNNY, ### but if you think about it if you are a hospital and you need to take a baby away from its mother out of the room to run some tests you better have some good security theater or she's going to rip your arm off
5030, FUNNY, ### she knew just how to torture me without knowing
2164, NOTFUNNY, ### we did it so fast we weren't prepared for their collapse
1649, NOTFUNNY, ### the components of this material are just water and protein
2218, FUNNY, ### they have graphic designers
15153, NOTFUNNY, ### it was mike the first thermonuclear bomb in
14271, NOTFUNNY, ### and very rapidly they became multi cellular they could replicate they could use photosynthesis as a way of getting their energy source
4201, FUNNY, ### so i took a look at my life a hard look at my life and i saw some things very disturbing
3927, NOTFUNNY, ### they see a man of action
8496, FUNNY, ### just type over it
7600, FUNNY, ### okay here goes
956, FUNNY, ### i'm just pro arithmetic
10831, NOTFUNNY, ### she's a new caledonian crow
12596, FUNNY, ### and some governments told me that it's fascinating that the younger generation actually thinks about these things
2976, FUNNY, ### and when i asked the woman who had designed this experience why it worked she simply said never underestimate the power of a ridiculous wig
12149, NOTFUNNY, ### it can also be used in defense
3187, FUNNY, ### as you remember the apple did nothing at all
8726, NOTFUNNY, ### and they're questions that i've asked of science television producers of audiences of science educators so that's science teachers and also of seven and i find that the seven do marginally better than the other audiences which is somewhat surprising
8553, NOTFUNNY, ### between and domestic violence among adult women in the united states has gone down by percent and that is great news
12019, FUNNY, ### so that's three points for insects
12195, FUNNY, ### really
14184, FUNNY, ### and i also learned that it can be helpful to think about girls
2552, FUNNY, ### and they also promise that they're going to transcribe only the gist of your messages
2790, NOTFUNNY, ### i hope that years hence people will hear about my treatments and be appalled that anyone endured such primitive science
10519, FUNNY, ### take a simple sentence
7530, FUNNY, ### they started suspecting that what we do on the morning and the afternoon it's on the news bbc
8315, NOTFUNNY, ### you can help to smuggle this civilian body count into government archives
10228, NOTFUNNY, ### literally the transition from ignorance to knowledge is
7618, NOTFUNNY, ### and mantis shrimp are officially the fastest measured feeding strike of any animal system
1797, FUNNY, ### in his deeply authentic self he also loved needlepoint
13233, NOTFUNNY, ### this is donna at the statue of liberty
4542, FUNNY, ### so maldives beautiful place
7753, FUNNY, ### the us election matters a lot on that one too
1183, FUNNY, ### welcome i love you
6052, FUNNY, ### you know so when you leave living rooms in europe people say thankfully nobody was ironic in your presence
12125, FUNNY, ### they say it's okay we'll email you
2949, FUNNY, ### it is simply how we protect our walls
7384, NOTFUNNY, ### it's my dad
3322, FUNNY, ### because if you sit a long time in summer in shorts you will walk away with temporary branding of the story element on your thighs
13899, NOTFUNNY, ### i'm going to talk all about that
10007, NOTFUNNY, ### but i can surely tell you that in my country much like on wall street and the city of london and elsewhere men were at the helm of the game of the financial sector and that kind of lack of diversity and sameness leads to disastrous problems
9171, NOTFUNNY, ### so before we send people we send robots
7281, NOTFUNNY, ### for intelligent design it's the end of the chain
14739, FUNNY, ### now look at the other it doesn't forget to eat of course
3773, FUNNY, ### if you ever think that your life is rubbish always remember there's another you that's made much worse decisions than that
4130, FUNNY, ### they have the social
6800, NOTFUNNY, ### and so i might say yesterday i throve
1035, FUNNY, ### what you should in fact do is employ all of the world's top male and female supermodels pay them to walk the length of the train handing out free chateau petrus for the entire duration of the journey
899, NOTFUNNY, ### same amount of weight but different sound colors
8584, NOTFUNNY, ### i then rounded the very bend where his blue truck heavy with four tons of floor tiles had borne down with great speed onto the back left corner of the minibus where i sat
2406, FUNNY, ### in fact one of the voices actually dictated the answers during the exam which technically possibly counts as cheating
9314, NOTFUNNY, ### we raised the reward
8564, NOTFUNNY, ### there were months years i didn't know about it
8441, FUNNY, ### germany because it had an alliance with austria told russia to stop mobilizing which russia failed to do so then germany mobilized its own army declared war on russia cemented an alliance with the and then declared war on france because you know france
6842, NOTFUNNY, ### in fact i'll try to explain today that sync is maybe one of if not one of the most perhaps the most pervasive drive in all of nature
3809, FUNNY, ### but harry's wife is confused because she said you know harry had been packing his own lunch for years
3526, FUNNY, ### this one is called the talk to yourself hat
202, FUNNY, ### this is actually the place that we put into the building so i could propose to my wife right there
7322, NOTFUNNY, ### so let's consider an example of this that's completely theoretical
14816, FUNNY, ### now i don't think he meant to insult the rest of science although he was from new zealand so it's possible
9529, NOTFUNNY, ### there's a way that i think that this too is a sign
5265, NOTFUNNY, ### so from both directions there is kind of i think a lack of understanding about what it could mean to be an artist who uses the materials of his own day or her own day which i think artists are obliged to do is to really explore the expressive potential of the new tools that we have
4511, FUNNY, ### and when they see him physically it is at public functions like this and even there it is him who advises them
13622, NOTFUNNY, ### i give a guest lecture for her when she teaches
9434, NOTFUNNY, ### and then coming to this conference i realized that most everybody here shared those same qualities because really what trickster is is an agent of change
11038, NOTFUNNY, ### and after years of searching i found a prototype
11651, NOTFUNNY, ### that's about all it can do
12524, FUNNY, ### elders came to me and said are you running from the police i said no
1050, NOTFUNNY, ### if you had a large red button of this kind on the wall of your home and every time you pressed it it saved dollars for you put dollars into your pension you would save a lot more
15263, FUNNY, ### when i go to an academic cocktail party and there are all the professors around they ask me what field i'm in and i say philosophy their eyes glaze over
9309, NOTFUNNY, ### by day nine you look at this picture and you're horrified i look at this picture and i say thank god because it's clear that this is only an ordinary case of smallpox and i know this child will live
7965, FUNNY, ### this guy decided he would go down to the amazon and give it a whirl or give it a lick and he did and he wrote my blood pressure went through the roof i lost full control of my bodily functions i passed out in a heap i woke up in a hammock six hours later felt like god for two days
14140, FUNNY, ### but no you don't
6553, NOTFUNNY, ### and they react
5213, FUNNY, ### we got a flood of donations mostly checks because new york times readers are very generous in tiny amounts but then we got a money transfer for really nice guy
1021, NOTFUNNY, ### it was with the elephants that this story pivoted
1056, FUNNY, ### thirty two men did that last october
473, NOTFUNNY, ### i built it
7020, NOTFUNNY, ### whether the man and woman decide to have small family and take care of their kids and how long they will live
3888, FUNNY, ### and i should know because during the time i attended that school a military takeover happened in my country a gunman of my nationality nearly killed the pope and turkey got zero points in the song contest
2954, NOTFUNNY, ### from my home village in burkina faso to berlin in germany to become an architect is a big big step
8821, NOTFUNNY, ### as they went from the first building to the second each of them passed a man who was bent over and moaning clearly in need
13184, FUNNY, ### see
3399, NOTFUNNY, ### this isn't it's the local currency
6470, FUNNY, ### i am not sure of that
2970, NOTFUNNY, ### and i do believe that business will move the great mass of humanity forward
11498, FUNNY, ### god damn it
6913, FUNNY, ### i said what's gone i thought maybe the mirror box was gone
551, NOTFUNNY, ### on a still bigger scale we see entire galaxies of stars
2089, FUNNY, ### i want to talk about the next six months
10047, NOTFUNNY, ### because there's no copyright protection in this industry there's a very open and creative ecology of creativity
12057, FUNNY, ### so he's not a real doctor either
2580, NOTFUNNY, ### they have every language in the world
4606, NOTFUNNY, ### my inability to swim has been one of my greatest humiliations and embarrassments
7060, FUNNY, ### but the thing about self expression is that there's traditionally been this imbalance between the desire that we have to express ourselves and the number of sympathetic friends who are willing to stand around and listen
7609, FUNNY, ### and yeah
5041, NOTFUNNY, ### i don't have the right answer
3046, FUNNY, ### the big discoveries are all behind us
4835, FUNNY, ### i think that's good luck
2494, FUNNY, ### it's even longer than the time it takes for italy to form a stable government
13364, FUNNY, ### and it's pretty incredible because i took my there and he was like yeah do you want an upgrade yes
51, FUNNY, ### it wasn't until i got to the airport check in counter that i realized i didn't have my passport
377, FUNNY, ### we got so out on making wall e this convincing robot that we made his binoculars practically optically perfect
5401, FUNNY, ### i've never met a man who's been asked how he does it all
75, FUNNY, ### they didn't fill out my survey
15573, NOTFUNNY, ### it's because possibilities on this planet they don't go back they go forward
10582, NOTFUNNY, ### the first stage was completed at home which consisted of the chicken grilling the chicken amassing it and preparing it to be transported to the lab
10184, FUNNY, ### he knew before he arrived that the foundation was going to be live streaming his event but what he didn't know until he turned up was that they'd erected a giant screen feed right next to his head
385, FUNNY, ### so we had this little communication breakdown
3339, NOTFUNNY, ### there are many science based analyses of this but they all draw the same conclusion that we're living beyond our means
2136, FUNNY, ### so that overmatched capability creates problems catastrophic successes the white house calls them
13900, NOTFUNNY, ### in september of scientific american came out with a single topic issue about the brain
4779, NOTFUNNY, ### a few years ago i reinvented my process to keep up with people like greg lynn thom mayne hadid rem koolhaas all these people that i think are and pioneering with fantastic new ideas of how to create form
10528, NOTFUNNY, ### this funky little thing people didn't used to think that it was worth taking samples out of nuclear reactors because it was dangerous and of course nothing lived there
1220, FUNNY, ### i went back and i transformed my entire company into a one buttock company
11848, NOTFUNNY, ### but this is really just the tip of the iceberg
7902, FUNNY, ### on earth we have whiskey
8246, NOTFUNNY, ### child care is expensive more than they'd earn in a job
12526, FUNNY, ### this technology the women will not share with the men
977, NOTFUNNY, ### but even more importantly he created a language a way we could communicate a code of dots dashes and arrows
3, FUNNY, ### a lot of people in this room make a good living pushing them around
15211, NOTFUNNY, ### we liked each other we liked the same kind of things
14196, NOTFUNNY, ### so children both know more and learn more than we ever would have thought
12344, FUNNY, ### first of all i had black hair before that
13339, FUNNY, ### it was people from all around the world speaking in their native languages to be judged by five french strangers
11315, NOTFUNNY, ### we have to have the courage to admit that to start changing how we deal with it
3973, NOTFUNNY, ### but i do think that the numbers i am about to tell you are empowering
6545, FUNNY, ### sorry for that
1595, FUNNY, ### and he said let's get married
11283, NOTFUNNY, ### and i didn't learn about this actually practicing law and doing the work that i do
4181, NOTFUNNY, ### these symbols endure because when we look at them we're looking at mirrors
1157, NOTFUNNY, ### i've been in the private sector for two years now
10610, FUNNY, ### and the vast majority of teachers reports believing that the ideal student is an extrovert as opposed to an introvert even though actually get better grades and are more knowledgeable according to research
14340, FUNNY, ### it says never look at the trombones it only encourages them
10196, NOTFUNNY, ### you know another woman on that night a new statesman writer helen lewis she reviewed my book on public shaming and wrote that she that night i'm not sure that her joke was intended to be racist and she said straightaway she got a fury of saying well you're just a privileged bitch too
810, FUNNY, ### we were walking with him holding onto my shoulder i miscalculated how much space there was between us and i knocked him into a gate
15292, NOTFUNNY, ### i was elected in and at the end of my first year in office in i got a call from one of my staff members who said gov we have a big problem
14364, NOTFUNNY, ### see he is there percent but not commanding not telling what to do
9594, FUNNY, ### and those are usually the basic scientists the bottom is usually the surgeons
11358, FUNNY, ### we like to say that these gals have no room for a womb or any other internal organ
5641, FUNNY, ### in fact it appeared in a porno comic book which is the slide on the right
6044, FUNNY, ### and his date was to go with him to a community meeting
4041, NOTFUNNY, ### this is part of which is a discontinuity in the global economy
8463, NOTFUNNY, ### we went through an iterative process of producing better and better models
4873, NOTFUNNY, ### and who would have guessed that the programming of the black box flight recorder of supersonic concord would have been done by a bunch of women working in their own homes
14972, FUNNY, ### i'm a jewish guy from new jersey
32, NOTFUNNY, ### i was doing graffiti writing my name everywhere using the city as a canvas
2073, FUNNY, ### it's made to feel by magazines and other media outlets that if you've got energy a few bright ideas about technology a garage you too could start a major thing
10511, NOTFUNNY, ### so i've had to write some notes to avoid too much grunting and swearing in the next minutes
9834, FUNNY, ### now one of the things about play is that it is born by curiosity and exploration
7849, FUNNY, ### so i'm on the right stage
3379, NOTFUNNY, ### i actually got nico i hadn't heard from in months and he just left a message two days ago
14880, FUNNY, ### nice people with common sense do not make interesting characters
9115, FUNNY, ### now of course i can bring up a keyboard
7240, NOTFUNNY, ### so if there was a fertility issue or some problem i had data to show look we got pregnant our temperature shifted we somehow lost this baby
8950, FUNNY, ### by the way if you are a boy it's snails if you're a girl it's butterflies because what we found was that girls hate snails
12213, NOTFUNNY, ### so i'd like to talk about why that is why that's such a calamity for society what we can do about it and to close with why this is an amazing time to be a math teacher
6064, NOTFUNNY, ### i'm not here to argue against science and math
3430, NOTFUNNY, ### but over the last years that significant difference has become a grand canyon of sorts between those at the top and everyone else
7076, NOTFUNNY, ### the music was in some ways different but in structure and form very much the same
13794, FUNNY, ### after all it's not just a question of hygiene but there's a possibility of recreation as well
1131, NOTFUNNY, ### today we have the third largest film industry in the world
8512, NOTFUNNY, ### let me tell you a little bit about a couple of new deceptions we've been tracking and documenting
2033, NOTFUNNY, ### and for this purpose we placed two on opposite sides of the body
11634, FUNNY, ### you're born you peak at midlife and decline into
335, FUNNY, ### one of those businesses was a computer rental business called micros on the move which is very well named because people kept stealing the computers
14180, FUNNY, ### but the first few systems were these leaky loud power guzzlers that martha stewart would definitely never have approved
