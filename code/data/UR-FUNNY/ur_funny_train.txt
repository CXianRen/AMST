6714, FUNNY, ### com which is barbie klaus
4449, FUNNY, ### my wife understandably thinks i'm rather morbid to begin my day with scrambled eggs and a let's see who died today
7436, NOTFUNNY, ### so when i started to dream in color is when i felt that the software and my brain had united because in my dreams it was my brain creating electronic sounds
7682, FUNNY, ### so i decided that the best thing to do would be to convert my garage into a laboratory
5501, NOTFUNNY, ### it's the only paper that will ever be freely accessible by this journal
1471, FUNNY, ### we are going to have to start all over again
9750, NOTFUNNY, ### building identity is about changing the world
8926, NOTFUNNY, ### but we now stand on the verge of another revolution in accuracy
12746, NOTFUNNY, ### in the middle we have a motor and we also have a gear in it and we use the gear to transfer the circulation of the motor
3998, FUNNY, ### okay
14609, NOTFUNNY, ### i was a student at harvard and i loved to travel
15493, FUNNY, ### so i'm mostly driving along okay and then i saw this sign
13327, NOTFUNNY, ### so because of all of this our oracle is a billion industry
15341, FUNNY, ### she says that there is only a limited number of ways you can screw well she says it in another way and she has tried them all
3560, FUNNY, ### and all we've got is a
419, NOTFUNNY, ### i was there to report on that story in cartoons
7402, FUNNY, ### there's not a lot of places you can put those skills in the civilian world
4014, FUNNY, ### and that's actually my eye and again this video was taken right after my daughter was born so you can see i wasn't getting too much sleep
10566, NOTFUNNY, ### finally i bought a tiny dinghy
15352, FUNNY, ### despite the new york times' and vanity fair's best efforts recently they're not brothers
7841, FUNNY, ### i was a very very serious child
6153, NOTFUNNY, ### and like i said we have those divorced friends who may secretly or subconsciously be trying to break us up
7564, FUNNY, ### it's because well thousands of years ago people invented ideas they had ideas innovations technology and the stone age ended not because we ran out of stones
87, NOTFUNNY, ### why is this maybe original people just have bad work habits
8287, NOTFUNNY, ### and this is actually a rather good comparison it seems to me
2111, FUNNY, ### i wanted a registered retirement savings plan that would keep me in candy long enough to make old age sweet
10523, FUNNY, ### not integrated circuits indians and chinese
10348, FUNNY, ### when can we talk because we need to talk
3870, FUNNY, ### so what we're trying to do really is take our chicken modify it and make the
4504, NOTFUNNY, ### america would never kill its way to the end of its wars it argued
5348, NOTFUNNY, ### now that's about all the videotape that remains of an event that set off the longest running mystery in the modern wine world
5963, FUNNY, ### president is there on borrowed time just waiting for the senate to spring into action
393, FUNNY, ### and then so she realized i couldn't catch live ones so she brought me dead penguins
766, FUNNY, ### take a look you could play it in the dump with some rocks over there you could play it in a little alley you couldn't hit square anywhere because the bat hit the wall don't forget the air conditioning and the cable wires
6036, NOTFUNNY, ### and when we laugh with people we're hardly ever actually laughing at jokes
13990, FUNNY, ### and that actually makes pretty hard for all of us which is i guess why they gave a tv show to the guy who was like really great at
5288, FUNNY, ### and so to me i wanted more value in this so when she asked if she could play a game i said yes
2882, FUNNY, ### anyway her tail catches on fire from the back of the volcano
6229, NOTFUNNY, ### they were at the bottom of the menu they were like fifth i thought they had no chance
12578, FUNNY, ### i think this is really cool
12287, FUNNY, ### if i go on like this you will be here till midnight
8170, FUNNY, ### and then i told as many many people as i possibly could about it so that there was no way that i could chicken out later on
13650, FUNNY, ### hey hey hey get away from abrams years ago if we wanted to do that we'd have to kill a
5649, FUNNY, ### it was a joke
10455, FUNNY, ### they would not leave me alone until i let them have a piece but it was not a good one
13871, NOTFUNNY, ### i've tried to show in this though the color doesn't come out that what i'm concerned with is the little time bubble that you are in
5524, NOTFUNNY, ### any gaps that appeared in the outskirts were filled again
4739, FUNNY, ### so you've grown up and reached the age of reason and now god will start keeping notes on you and begin your permanent record
11214, NOTFUNNY, ### i use information education
8448, NOTFUNNY, ### i learned that the civil war was a nationalizing conflict i learned some physics i learned that correlation shouldn't be confused with causation all of these things by the way enriched my life on a literally daily basis
2542, FUNNY, ### hold on
10488, NOTFUNNY, ### the next five years there were essentially something like five references to our work in nature none
14094, FUNNY, ### there are mushrooms that grow faster than printed parts
888, FUNNY, ### snow
7444, FUNNY, ### ok now if you did not allow me to deceive your minds you would all be able to do this
12816, FUNNY, ### so it's going to be really important that he be able to drive me around someday
10127, NOTFUNNY, ### we learned directly how to struggle through really tough medical decisions
11454, FUNNY, ### some of you look a little more enthusiastic than others at this prospect
2129, FUNNY, ### that chicken wing changed my life
14881, FUNNY, ### i looked like a refrigerator
12360, NOTFUNNY, ### and i did well i graduated with honors cum laude
12942, FUNNY, ### you have to have more things wrong than right
5642, FUNNY, ### i couldn't deal with the success of furniture i wasn't secure enough as an architect and so i closed it all up and made furniture that nobody would like
10978, FUNNY, ### but she told me mom you don't have to worry about boys because i don't like them
14189, FUNNY, ### what's making this light up
12219, FUNNY, ### better put that up
10543, NOTFUNNY, ### so these genes are indeed going back to the populations
7565, NOTFUNNY, ### it's great stuff
6699, NOTFUNNY, ### now when i say that what most people hear me say is that we're working on curing cancer
5697, FUNNY, ### parents and teachers were comfortable in talking about periods to young girls using the book and sometimes even boys were interested in reading it
12271, NOTFUNNY, ### that's between say at an average use that's maybe to homes could run off that
12892, FUNNY, ### we even have rules for how to follow the rules
5365, NOTFUNNY, ### this is neda the iranian girl who was shot while at a demonstration with her father in iran only a few weeks ago and she is now the focus rightly so of the generation
2429, FUNNY, ### counting rice will be another thing
15007, FUNNY, ### the reason i'm waving with my left hand is because on the right hand is the emergency cutaway
3407, NOTFUNNY, ### so it was good to survive with that little tool that i found to find my own place in school
3360, FUNNY, ### it was very difficult actually putting these people in the machine because they were in such bad shape
13263, FUNNY, ### i said you know your marriage is the subject of global obsession
10870, NOTFUNNY, ### you have a molecule coming in it gets into the protein which is schematic here and it causes this thing to switch to turn to move in some way by binding in certain parts
1621, FUNNY, ### and of course there are teams that have a lot more ta da structures and among the best are recent graduates of kindergarten
5857, FUNNY, ### i looked up at the red buzzer far behind joe on the opposite wall
10500, FUNNY, ### oh it's going to be so much fun
15218, NOTFUNNY, ### surprise number two medical marijuana does have some risks
6803, NOTFUNNY, ### and we just divide one by the other to produce something we call a suppression index
229, NOTFUNNY, ### and so you know it's one of those things that you don't take too seriously
10850, NOTFUNNY, ### you have to use your sense memory to reconstruct the emotions and kind of think with your body to find the right expression improvise play off your scene partner
11461, NOTFUNNY, ### let's try something different
14608, FUNNY, ### maybe this is what it's like to be on the other side of
15610, NOTFUNNY, ### when i'm making these pieces i'm always trying to find a point where i'm saying something very clearly and it's very simple but also at the same time it's very ambiguous
9707, NOTFUNNY, ### and so inside of this environment we're experimenting with all kinds of things
13888, NOTFUNNY, ### this is really a world within a world and we're going to show you two
12736, FUNNY, ### that's more than you pay for ted if dropped their sponsorship
3969, NOTFUNNY, ### i remember it was a thursday morning and she was not available to speak with me
782, NOTFUNNY, ### it was never promoted it was never sold it was organized
7082, FUNNY, ### my favorite page is the about the author page
5615, FUNNY, ### now that's something i fall short of on a daily basis
3531, FUNNY, ### i asked crystal the price of the cookie that i had selected and she said three dollars
3282, FUNNY, ### i've never been maybe next year
13558, NOTFUNNY, ### five of clubs
4526, FUNNY, ### i love this image so much for a lot of different reasons
4893, NOTFUNNY, ### yes macy all right
4639, NOTFUNNY, ### i broke my collarbone
5638, NOTFUNNY, ### steve grand points out that you and i are ourselves more like a wave than a permanent thing
14367, NOTFUNNY, ### and all you put together in partnership brings about the best music
12357, FUNNY, ### s
4860, NOTFUNNY, ### as of a few years ago no scientist could tell you what bugs or microorganisms live in your home your home the place you know better than anywhere else
6874, FUNNY, ### and what we need is something that replicates me globally because i haven't slept in seven years
11511, NOTFUNNY, ### for them there's no modern toilet
14750, NOTFUNNY, ### and human morality is more than this but if you would remove these two pillars there would be not much remaining i think
10016, NOTFUNNY, ### and our guide was a local science teacher
2738, FUNNY, ### and you control their thinking not like this although that would be cool
11761, NOTFUNNY, ### tom green yeah
2353, FUNNY, ### hillary's completely gone
6349, FUNNY, ### is that all all right let me show you some more about this
10805, FUNNY, ### i was hooked
8879, NOTFUNNY, ### one of the national aeronautics goals is to develop the next generation of fuels using domestic and safe friendly resources
10060, NOTFUNNY, ### now i'm not saying your girls must be firefighters or that they should be but i am saying that we are raising our girls to be timid even helpless and it begins when we caution them against physical risk
9960, NOTFUNNY, ### however consumers have moved
14276, FUNNY, ### so this little guy has found himself this babe and you will note that he's had the good sense to attach himself in a way that he doesn't actually have to look at her
213, FUNNY, ### i would like us to work towards that
8090, NOTFUNNY, ### so the light bulb is what wired the world
14709, FUNNY, ### i don't have a word for that yet but i will
10372, NOTFUNNY, ### so i want to suggest that pleasure is deep and that this isn't true just for higher level pleasures like art but even the most seemingly simple pleasures are affected by our beliefs about hidden
11715, NOTFUNNY, ### and then there was another influence
15067, NOTFUNNY, ### and it's continuous across the complete spectrum of the various kind of realities that you confront with your ideas
4985, NOTFUNNY, ### success was just as much about pleasing key figures as it was about satisfying one's own preferences
12868, FUNNY, ### the lesson is don't even try
14122, NOTFUNNY, ### this grew into a passion for finding things a love for the past and archaeology
108, NOTFUNNY, ### whereas to pursue all three with equal dedication is to make possible a life filled not only with achievement but with serenity
7767, FUNNY, ### if you're like most people when you hear the words our organization is going to start a transformation you're thinking uh oh
630, FUNNY, ### now in fairness if you've spent any time at all in washington you know this is really a radical concept for the government
12509, FUNNY, ### this one's called love song's nest
938, NOTFUNNY, ### it would be helpful if humanity got into the habit of thinking of the now not just as next week or next quarter but you know next years and the last years basically story so far
798, NOTFUNNY, ### so i quit my company and started a career as a professional performer
1562, NOTFUNNY, ### those straight parents often want them to function in what they think of as the mainstream world and those gay people have to discover identity later on
4075, NOTFUNNY, ### there is absolutely no reason why poor people can't learn world class technology
13993, FUNNY, ### it took so long to get these ants to do this
1528, FUNNY, ### at eight years old i took my ideas and started my own business called ideas and my nonprofit ideas for the planet
14984, FUNNY, ### probably about as many as there are creative people here
14073, FUNNY, ### today i use it
637, FUNNY, ### so this is the one that can't walk at all
3616, FUNNY, ### and if you had a tug competition the tesla semi will tug the diesel semi uphill
3474, FUNNY, ### i look at that picture now and i think you did not need a diet you needed a fashion consult
8239, FUNNY, ### for example when rosie a little girl who spoke only spanish moved in next door brianna who spoke only english borrowed her mother's tablet and found a translation app so the two of them could communicate
460, FUNNY, ### decided to make a paintbrush
240, FUNNY, ### to me that was the golden age
4180, FUNNY, ### what you'll do is sign in create a note that this particular is already taken
10446, FUNNY, ### so the best thing that happened to us so far in the medical arena in cancer research is the fact that the refrigerator was invented
1922, NOTFUNNY, ### these people are at risk these people are truant
9305, FUNNY, ### i love it
3782, NOTFUNNY, ### steven weinberg the nobel laureate once said the more the universe seems comprehensible the more it seems pointless
9866, FUNNY, ### the acid will ruin the gold plating
12408, FUNNY, ### big events in my life a strange child
5011, NOTFUNNY, ### it's called we feel fine
5283, NOTFUNNY, ### and on the bottom left is a thermal camera
10988, NOTFUNNY, ### i usually have to just like try to calm down and take a deep breath
12505, FUNNY, ### one of these is scratch off masterpieces
14337, FUNNY, ### he means mozart which is like a third seat from the center
2508, NOTFUNNY, ### and no one really knew how significant these protests were because for whatever reason the world media largely ignored it
8361, NOTFUNNY, ### and i try to figure out how that works
1147, FUNNY, ### so i strode into the headquarters building and my eyes scanned the row of un flags and i smiled as i thought to myself the engineer is here
2922, FUNNY, ### i would too if i were you
7272, FUNNY, ### you could dowse for all sorts of things but this particular one was built to dowse for marijuana in students' lockers
3605, FUNNY, ### so i think there's a fairly straightforward series of steps to get somewhere in excess of an order of magnitude improvement in the cost per mile and our target actually is we've got a pet snail called gary this is from gary the snail from south park i mean sorry
5716, FUNNY, ### i'm sorry to say that
11811, FUNNY, ### and then i got people saying leave him
1811, NOTFUNNY, ### and you end you end up following your heart and feeling very fulfilled
14295, FUNNY, ### what you are is a
3578, FUNNY, ### and then because you've felt that satisfaction you're less motivated to do the actual hard work necessary
9619, FUNNY, ### now i made sure to shave my legs last night because i knew i'd be showing them off
10249, NOTFUNNY, ### and i walked up to the bedside of an old woman who was breathing very rapidly fragile obviously in the latter phase of active dying
2620, FUNNY, ### i do actually feel more alien the longer i live there
14808, FUNNY, ### and i give them access to me every single day which is why they all have my personal cell number including my scholars and those who graduated which is probably why i get phone calls and text messages at three o'clock in the morning
3267, NOTFUNNY, ### but for mary this meeting is different
7898, FUNNY, ### i have spent too much time in california and i strongly feel that weather should be optional
2054, FUNNY, ### yes i have even come across a toilet paper whose brand is called thank you
5034, FUNNY, ### or maybe you're the only one who had to go to the bathroom
7389, FUNNY, ### now the reason i have this beautiful asteroid fragment is because like all neighbors asteroids sometimes drop by unexpectedly
3528, NOTFUNNY, ### and this has really gotten me thinking about this experience of the initial encounter
4927, FUNNY, ### by the way you did hear me correctly his last name is hacker
12141, FUNNY, ### now mostly tails limit maneuverability like this human inside this dinosaur suit
14539, FUNNY, ### so i do it
11070, FUNNY, ### so all we have is this record
15135, FUNNY, ### damn it i can be just as stubborn as this thing
12159, NOTFUNNY, ### it may not be very accurate but it may make you say
3475, FUNNY, ### now if your mother ever mentioned that life is not fair this is the kind of thing she was talking about
3660, FUNNY, ### i was clearly more interested in the rubik's cube than my younger brother
27, FUNNY, ### so he went to the church of nativity and brought back an old ladder that was so old that it could have seen jesus being born
6801, NOTFUNNY, ### we are losing interest in the past more rapidly
13950, FUNNY, ### so i took the experiment out of delhi and repeated it this time in a city called in the center of india where i was assured that nobody had ever taught anybody anything
4171, FUNNY, ### i get to read about mother jokes from mesopotamia from years ago
14209, FUNNY, ### we're working on also simpler technology not that complex with younger people and also older people like this dinosaur is from mexico
6600, FUNNY, ### but you've got to yeah well up until then every building leaked so this
9166, FUNNY, ### this is david oh one of our flight directors and he's at the beach in los angeles with his family at in the morning
8551, FUNNY, ### men don't talk
9651, FUNNY, ### here we are using the same word to talk about love that we use to explain a plague of locusts
9273, FUNNY, ### just go with me
13930, NOTFUNNY, ### i can also understand that sort of implicit criticism in this piece s which i made when i was living in copenhagen
1004, FUNNY, ### all right there's this episode of star trek
3688, FUNNY, ### although i still get quite irritable when africa is referred to as a country the most recent example being my otherwise wonderful flight from lagos two days ago in which there was an announcement on the virgin flight about the charity work in india africa and other countries
4118, NOTFUNNY, ### but every cell in your body is replaced at some point
1022, FUNNY, ### it's a self portrait titled wide hips
8413, NOTFUNNY, ### it's then pumped with toxic formaldehyde to slow decomposition a practice which causes respiratory problems and cancer in funeral personnel
7058, NOTFUNNY, ### little kids especially are attracted by colorful packaging and plastic toys
9297, NOTFUNNY, ### they did not invent car sharing
9031, NOTFUNNY, ### also thou shalt not disregard the irrational
4156, FUNNY, ### exhibiting pac man and alongside picasso and van gogh they're two floors away
3241, FUNNY, ### i wanted to try it in the most extreme situations to see if i could slow my heart rate down under duress
11533, NOTFUNNY, ### it's based on an approach called string theory and that's where the idea of the will come into the story
13193, FUNNY, ### this was a mother's day gift
10685, NOTFUNNY, ### and so what i'm going to do is i'm going to pour wax in the ears of you and all the men stay with me so that you can't hear the song and then i'm going to have you tie me to the mast so that i can listen and we can all sail by unaffected
7432, FUNNY, ### this is the sound of a dirty sock
3128, FUNNY, ### no just joking
9556, FUNNY, ### they say they are the ones who produce the garbage not them
11150, NOTFUNNY, ### they were doing wonderful
10882, FUNNY, ### there was no motorcade back there
1330, NOTFUNNY, ### that's because getting only red eyed mosquitos violates a rule that is the absolute cornerstone of biology genetics
2151, FUNNY, ### for eight years after screwing up the relationship on day one inauguration day with gays in the military which was deft
12613, NOTFUNNY, ### so maybe history doesn't repeat itself but sometimes it rhymes
13176, NOTFUNNY, ### there are doctors academics and who have written countless volumes on the many facets of this complex subject
451, FUNNY, ### and they moved in and decided not to pay me any rent
10066, FUNNY, ### i mean it's i have my friends therefore i am
7187, NOTFUNNY, ### so we're left with a situation where we know that our earliest ancestors were moving around on four legs in the trees before the savanna ecosystem even came into existence
9072, NOTFUNNY, ### with this job all i needed were my hands and my massage table by my side and i could go anywhere
2441, NOTFUNNY, ### and so we can encapsulate these regions of ultra conservation through evolution how these viruses evolved by just choosing elements or elements in these regions to represent on our chip as detection reagents
5724, NOTFUNNY, ### and if that wasn't bad enough of course all of this is rapidly progressing towards the fact that many of you in fact about one in of you at this point will die in intensive care
11324, NOTFUNNY, ### we're all one family
5141, NOTFUNNY, ### we can step into the lab and measure how good your vision is
10703, NOTFUNNY, ### this first one internet zero up here this is a web server that has the cost and complexity of an tag about a dollar that can go in every light bulb and doorknob and this is getting commercialized very quickly
1571, FUNNY, ### i arranged for his plane to be delayed
5479, NOTFUNNY, ### i don't know what cat gut is but let's assume it's formidable
493, FUNNY, ### i'm pleased to say that thanks to massive government funding about three years ago we finally figured out how bees fly
576, FUNNY, ### but when he actually had a university of pittsburgh sweatshirt cheating went down
5146, FUNNY, ### what was interesting to us is that the european headline writers had a different take they said are your friends gaining weight perhaps you are to blame
7923, FUNNY, ### suddenly we're almost longing for him to return
10716, FUNNY, ### i grabbed hold of it sat down and ate my breakfast with my pigs
7714, FUNNY, ### it's still early but i think we've picked up on the scent of something we're following
1884, FUNNY, ### and they sent this bureaucrat down to tell geiger that he was expected to use their dollars for medical care to which geiger famously and logically responded the last time i checked my textbooks the specific therapy for malnutrition was food
10793, FUNNY, ### so look you don't have to like what they do but you do have to respect the entrepreneurial nature of their endeavors
3199, FUNNY, ### and the shopkeeper would say it's old
8592, FUNNY, ### but second we have accidentally made it so that millions of workers around the world have unbelievably boring working lives
15122, NOTFUNNY, ### your contains one million times more connections than your genome has letters
1726, FUNNY, ### and i can actually recommend this book it's a very nice book
3687, FUNNY, ### she asked if she could listen to what she called my tribal music and was consequently very disappointed when i produced my tape of mariah carey
3658, FUNNY, ### is the one that used to be the most commonly used and i hated with a passion and refused to touch it and tried something else that was radical and interesting and everybody else hated
7154, NOTFUNNY, ### and it is certainly a wonder
14962, FUNNY, ### i don't want to get into the story now but i need you to come out
3260, FUNNY, ### so back in november during the election last year the only image that we could publish was this which was on the stand on the week that everybody voted
3449, NOTFUNNY, ### but no faces i find that hard to believe
14281, NOTFUNNY, ### and inside the sphere with me is an intensified camera that's about as sensitive as a fully dark adapted human eye albeit a little fuzzy
14082, NOTFUNNY, ### we need to think about the problem differently
1095, NOTFUNNY, ### we know that right we've experienced that
4986, NOTFUNNY, ### it requires that everyone treat choice as a private and self defining act
10919, FUNNY, ### but i love that the number one task posted over a hundred times a day is something that many of us have felt the pain of doing yes assembling ikea furniture
13715, NOTFUNNY, ### it's part of the answer
685, FUNNY, ### i like it too
3767, NOTFUNNY, ### largely it's the media who are to blame for this sort of thing
9610, FUNNY, ### you don't like it shake it and you have a lesbian couple
6749, NOTFUNNY, ### so i was flipping through the pages of the times of india when i saw that the prime minister of india was visiting my home town bangalore
13736, NOTFUNNY, ### coming round from anesthesia is very different
12587, FUNNY, ### i'm with him i'm going to echo his words i for one welcome our new computer overlords
11027, NOTFUNNY, ### so to compensate i'd hold the pen tighter and this progressively made the shake worse so i'd hold the pen tighter still
12388, FUNNY, ### like yourself i'm a complex amalgam of positive and negative personality traits that emerge or not depending on the circumstances
12637, FUNNY, ### we're measuring how many viruses and bacteria all of us are breathing in and out every day particularly on airplanes or closed auditoriums
8435, FUNNY, ### in the middle of nowhere expecting there to be a place called someone built a place called new york
879, FUNNY, ### right
4950, FUNNY, ### and the house where john wilkes booth planned the assassination of abraham lincoln is also now a chinese restaurant called wok and roll on h street in washington
796, FUNNY, ### but after coming back to japan totally nothing changed in my life
12620, FUNNY, ### that's it that's the lecture
14960, FUNNY, ### i think you just need to do a cleansing ritual
6028, FUNNY, ### he's not laughing yet
2002, FUNNY, ### it did tell me that this maybe missing sidewalks or pedestrian paths though
878, FUNNY, ### so remember these are primitive things so dancing that's very interesting to us
1885, NOTFUNNY, ### we had moms who would come in daughter has asthma wakes up covered in cockroaches every morning
11789, NOTFUNNY, ### so yeah this task does seem to be daunting
13007, NOTFUNNY, ### and you can imagine if you're a writer that things would get really crowded around deadlines

4341, NOTFUNNY, ### and when that happens the feeling is ecstatic and we reach for metaphors of up and down to explain these feelings
10939, NOTFUNNY, ### i started in to try and address this problem with an experiment which was a very simple experiment in new delhi
9492, FUNNY, ### spock
12011, NOTFUNNY, ### so they did this wonderful thing where they brought in first then then more architects each one of whom was assigned a library to rethink what a library was
6682, NOTFUNNY, ### and there were young people who were killing each other for reasons that i thought were very trivial like bumping into someone in a high school hallway and then after school shooting the person
8046, FUNNY, ### and the amazing thing to me is that you would think this woman would have excellent oral hygiene

11280, FUNNY, ### i said well what are you talking about he said oh mama tells all the grandkids that they're special
5607, NOTFUNNY, ### and that's probably the reason why i've chosen to be a functional neurosurgeon
380, NOTFUNNY, ### but then i got my first taste of lighting
1537, FUNNY, ### the first thing i learned that day was that i never ever wanted to work that hard again
7963, NOTFUNNY, ### thank you
11694, FUNNY, ### and while pregnant i had never been asked how i was feeling so much in all my life

12097, NOTFUNNY, ### two hours they gave me a message
5274, FUNNY, ### so if i normalize that to its size it's like a boeing traveling ten times the speed of sound
5598, FUNNY, ### humans and bonobos are the only animals that have sex face when both of them are alive
8509, FUNNY, ### in fact they lied about their height about nine tenths of an inch what we say in the lab as strong rounding up
9637, NOTFUNNY, ### as you can see the solar panel charges the battery and the battery supplies the power to the small indicator box

14891, NOTFUNNY, ### only a fearless and determined heart will get the gold medal
14043, FUNNY, ### it's a good thing ours is bigger because we're also really insecure
9661, NOTFUNNY, ### we made up

13663, NOTFUNNY, ### and it let me make things which to me was sort of the dream
14052, FUNNY, ### it's a story about us people being persuaded to spend money we don't have on things we don't need to create impressions that won't last on people we don't care about
3556, FUNNY, ### but let me remind you this december it did snow in vegas
15081, NOTFUNNY, ### and that tension that discovery that push for something new and at the same time that sense of obligation to the regards of craftsmanship that's as strong in cars as it is in anything
13732, FUNNY, ### i think is a really terrible idea
14722, FUNNY, ### and so i want to simulate fog and that's why i brought a handkerchief with me
12473, FUNNY, ### you know it's my view basically about religion that the real conflict and all the fights between religion is who has the best imaginary friend
3022, FUNNY, ### he was interested in productivity i think it's something that concerns all of us but it's easy to measure in chickens because you just count the eggs

1662, FUNNY, ### somebody's going to get my college grades out a that's going to be a disaster
3094, NOTFUNNY, ### i was at mit media lab and i was studying the maker movement and makers and creativity
11035, NOTFUNNY, ### and the look on my face is the feeling that i've been searching for ever since
13907, NOTFUNNY, ### the theorist guy says i think this is what's going on the experimentalist says you're wrong
1144, NOTFUNNY, ### so we have an opportunity to really open up education

8801, NOTFUNNY, ### the health argument is a scary one and you've probably heard part of this argument before
2795, NOTFUNNY, ### things are different because now i know that depression is the family secret that everyone has
26, FUNNY, ### then when the photo left the frame was still there
14274, FUNNY, ### so if you stagger into the head late at night and you're so toilet hugging sick that you forget to turn on the light you may think that you're having a religious experience
6850, NOTFUNNY, ### to find out we placed numerous baby clams on a grid
10422, NOTFUNNY, ### there are a couple of reasons for this that i'll mention to begin with
15476, FUNNY, ### so to use the sheep metaphor it's like we now have electric sheep that have a mind of their own
2462, FUNNY, ### so i said to myself with all these hundred other boys this is where i belong
15463, NOTFUNNY, ### this haze is ubiquitous
1028, FUNNY, ### i'm told they don't bite in fact they might not even leave that jar
2667, FUNNY, ### um yes
9333, NOTFUNNY, ### to see god's own plan in some sense
14282, NOTFUNNY, ### and so here in the gulf of maine at feet i can name pretty much everything you're seeing there to the species level
1094, FUNNY, ### what'll happen is that the styrofoam peanuts will start moving through our society here and they will accumulate in the people
3940, NOTFUNNY, ### and frankly my assumptions were wrong
1279, NOTFUNNY, ### it's a combination of that the beauty of that the shape and the stories that were involved in it as well as the fact that they protected the contents
5815, FUNNY, ### this was a bunch of guys and a few ladies widely varying in both age and upkeep
3820, FUNNY, ### i thought what a great way to get to school
5100, NOTFUNNY, ### one is fast food where everything is standardized
10969, FUNNY, ### but anyway
9189, NOTFUNNY, ### so the only way to control this message is actually to try to spin it and accuse anyone who has written something critical of being for example a cia agent
8456, FUNNY, ### they've really got to start talking to each other and exercise a bit of imagination if that's not too much to ask
1936, NOTFUNNY, ### so over the next couple of years students and i worked to develop a process
5157, FUNNY, ### someone installed a barrier people started walking across and round the bottom as you see and they paved it
8795, FUNNY, ### yet all of these innovations that's what they said in the brochure
2438, FUNNY, ### well doesn't have canine distemper that's probably good
9207, NOTFUNNY, ### thank you
12498, NOTFUNNY, ### if you think that the relative importance two to one wrong by a factor of ten
13428, FUNNY, ### then to clarify she went on he was not an environmentalist
12235, FUNNY, ### this is the last one
11429, FUNNY, ### now don't get me wrong we need money
4768, FUNNY, ### anyway
6943, NOTFUNNY, ### in short we're more optimistic than realistic but we are oblivious to the fact
14771, NOTFUNNY, ### i feel so lucky and i've been times in my life and all those people who come with us return home as great champions not only for antarctica but for local issues back in their own nations
13578, FUNNY, ### why precisely not to have to cooperate with my wife
14647, NOTFUNNY, ### we really are seeing the dawn of surgery
6159, NOTFUNNY, ### she was a mother who gave her life trying to get her son a chance at a better life
1539, FUNNY, ### so we went over into michael's garage his dad had all kinds of stuff and we put a pipe in the vice there and screwed a cap on the end of the pipe drilled a hole in the back of the pipe took some of our firecrackers pulled out the fuses tied them together put them in the back there and down in that hole and then stuffed some of our gunpowder down that pipe and put three ball bearings on the top in the garage
13931, NOTFUNNY, ### here's another example from another piece and then its realization
12717, NOTFUNNY, ### it is that simple
3734, NOTFUNNY, ### i'm going show you a video
2003, NOTFUNNY, ### and i think this is what we've done with climate change
4104, FUNNY, ### and you don't need the three billion dollar collider for doing this
1432, NOTFUNNY, ### we should call it what it is a business in liquidation a business that's quickly eroding ecological capital that makes that very production possible
269, NOTFUNNY, ### to be quite frank i'm concerned
12592, NOTFUNNY, ### a lot of people look at this and they say ok but those are very specific narrow tasks and most knowledge workers are actually generalists
7914, FUNNY, ### very good
13891, FUNNY, ### i found a website dedicated to teachers who want to make script writing things across the top of their blackboard and they had added graffiti to it and i'm sorry about that
11610, NOTFUNNY, ### my favorite role in life
2078, NOTFUNNY, ### why we might be victims of these career crises as we're weeping softly into our pillows
13889, NOTFUNNY, ### it's footage that we've collected for scientific purposes
11262, FUNNY, ### airport security
1606, FUNNY, ### i was called an idiot a traitor a scourge a and an ugly man and that was just in one email
3129, NOTFUNNY, ### i don't give a damn about the revolution
7081, FUNNY, ### i was clearly worried about my intellectual property when i was eight
13292, FUNNY, ### so it turned out that not only was the billboard still up but they had put this one right next to it
11155, FUNNY, ### the reality is that this issue is much too important to be left to politicians and to the united nations
12978, FUNNY, ### now i like to point out that we were on that list with a lot of really cool places
4827, NOTFUNNY, ### it's a true feeling
2042, NOTFUNNY, ### this doesn't make me natural or normal this is just one way of describing the many different ways that we exist in this world
14716, NOTFUNNY, ### and i think when we're all searching for meaning in our lives and searching for the meaning of life i think words have something to do with that
3500, NOTFUNNY, ### and interestingly the people who buy the most games are
1874, NOTFUNNY, ### we'll also need to grow more food with less farmland
12162, NOTFUNNY, ### and it might make you think perhaps there's an issue to do with areas
13240, FUNNY, ### one of my students came up after class an introductory class and she said you know poetry is harder than writing which i found both erroneous and profound
7160, FUNNY, ### on your rose bushes
7049, NOTFUNNY, ### so about years ago by the black sea we had one mutation in one gene which led to blue eyes
6182, NOTFUNNY, ### we teach it to our children
10721, FUNNY, ### this guy has thrashed me at my own game
12548, FUNNY, ### this as many of you have probably guessed is a recently emptied beer can in portugal
9190, FUNNY, ### and that ladies and gentlemen is how the soap opera one life to live introduced a love story that lasted years
13934, FUNNY, ### all you need is an internet connection and a funny cat
3062, NOTFUNNY, ### so there we are
1955, NOTFUNNY, ### if the person doesn't follow directions they may end up shooting them and then find out afterwards either yes we shot the right person or no this was just an innocent person who didn't understand what was going on
11693, NOTFUNNY, ### now despite all this rich life that abounds in these swamps they still have a bad name
3936, FUNNY, ### so i'm already feeling kind of aggravated and then i see this from pop up in my social media feed
901, FUNNY, ### what a company
3679, NOTFUNNY, ### and it doesn't really matter i don't want you understand why it doesn't have the if statement but i want you to understand that sometimes you can see a problem in a different way and rewrite it so that a special case goes away and becomes the normal case
6665, NOTFUNNY, ### they don't know ok and they're trying to get another member of the to join them
11773, FUNNY, ### before i met her i went through some search results
14691, NOTFUNNY, ### medical consultation medical treatment medicines they are all provided by the state
3070, FUNNY, ### it's by gal stripping that tissue we humanize it and then we can put it back into a patient's knee
13229, FUNNY, ### no pun intended
12624, FUNNY, ### ms okay
7894, NOTFUNNY, ### what i see is a cow about to eat something delicious
15406, FUNNY, ### so the rest of you can save them for when i say something particularly boring and then you can fire at me
6725, FUNNY, ### but it was too stony and full of cactus on top
3564, NOTFUNNY, ### if you look at the federal budget this is what it looks like
10466, FUNNY, ### and so i applied to and they turned me down
11657, NOTFUNNY, ### but no commercial source
13985, NOTFUNNY, ### but i'm going to show you some more candy sort of stuff
14589, NOTFUNNY, ### the teapot
9058, FUNNY, ### but first i have a new invention here
14948, FUNNY, ### that's older than my dad
3673, NOTFUNNY, ### apparently my sister said that my biggest exceptional quality was that i would not let go
8260, NOTFUNNY, ### in north idaho in my red pickup truck i kept a
408, FUNNY, ### i don't know if you've heard about it newspapers it's a sort of paper based reader
5054, FUNNY, ### the hippos and the said yes that's why we have no agriculture here
5447, FUNNY, ### i wanted them to be good inside too
1369, FUNNY, ### you know we're interested in like you know an awkward interaction or a smile or a contemptuous glance or maybe a very awkward wink or maybe even something like a handshake
2608, FUNNY, ### and i think the reason this image works again is because frieda is driving the bulldozer
12023, NOTFUNNY, ### and here you see just a selection
8086, NOTFUNNY, ### the inhumanity which this trail has been witness to the heartbreak and suffering which so many have undergone cannot be imagined
4518, FUNNY, ### this is how my brain works by the way
909, FUNNY, ### that's just the best
8347, FUNNY, ### not one single post office truck is stolen
4169, NOTFUNNY, ### so when i show the sims i try to make people really feel what it meant to have an interaction with the sims not only the fun but also the responsibility that came with the
10995, NOTFUNNY, ### but when they got older when the time comes for them to start think about getting married that's when we expect them to realize a little bit more their own culture
1855, NOTFUNNY, ### you could learn some tiny thing that forces you to everything you thought you knew
15141, FUNNY, ### even errors were duplicated
3783, NOTFUNNY, ### i can make my own purpose
2297, NOTFUNNY, ### super simple
11809, FUNNY, ### this is my husband who is very hot he won an award for being hot
426, FUNNY, ### and then i realize the octopus won the arms race because i was out and he had six left
3537, NOTFUNNY, ### he went on hikes with his parents
11844, FUNNY, ### this one you can see how ugly it is

12975, NOTFUNNY, ### it was actually interesting that such a communist principle was the basis of a system developed during the cold war by the defense department but it obviously worked really well and we all saw what happened with the internet

11316, NOTFUNNY, ### it is an economic crime because we're involving the looting of taxpayers' money
9949, FUNNY, ### so if you've been gone this is the on what's happened in the economy
4178, FUNNY, ### twins
1657, NOTFUNNY, ### it's about my vision
830, FUNNY, ### because in reality it was even uglier than the first version

7299, FUNNY, ### no
7070, NOTFUNNY, ### you can see a few of them are swarming around the cursor right now
8355, NOTFUNNY, ### i mean you're looking at the sales team
7474, NOTFUNNY, ### i'm so afraid of what i'm going to see
4468, FUNNY, ### but then i thought well in case of a fire i might be the last one to ignite
8389, NOTFUNNY, ### so in short i'm startled by all the things that they don't have
15443, FUNNY, ### if i'm not a ladybug or a piece of candy i'm invisible after minutes
6101, FUNNY, ### how come you don't give him this how come no one's really heard of you and it may be because of the wine or it may be because of my excitement he answered me directly and he said because chefs don't deserve my foie gras
7362, FUNNY, ### hopefully it's faster
3874, NOTFUNNY, ### you all know the story right
10159, FUNNY, ### and i think the big contributing factor may have been that this is how i decorated my high school bedroom
14404, NOTFUNNY, ### it's also hot huge and unruly made up of islands where people speak close to a thousand languages
3238, FUNNY, ### then i thought about the craziest idea of all the ideas to actually do it
2455, FUNNY, ### of course these people don't really look like scientists because they're much too happy
7394, NOTFUNNY, ### it's for that reason that many activists specifically avoid using the telephone
1945, NOTFUNNY, ### i had teamed up with john and was working hard hoping he would notice how great i was and that he would come to support my case to make partner at the firm
538, FUNNY, ### and after a few days depending upon temperature the egg will hatch and the larva of this parasite will eat the aphid from the inside
14668, FUNNY, ### yes i will come destroy the computer and defend my species

14354, NOTFUNNY, ### people who build this wonderful concert hall
10989, NOTFUNNY, ### so anyway what i was trying to say is that i really love ted
12370, FUNNY, ### so i went back on the nicest day of the year just to you know do some reality testing and in fact he will not even go down there because it's not interesting enough for his clients you know the burglars the muggers
15093, NOTFUNNY, ### the principle is you just need those three things variation selection and heredity

10544, FUNNY, ### i prefer blood shift
1666, FUNNY, ### we were all scientists so we used our scientific creativity and came up with a very creative name for our project
13942, FUNNY, ### it's really amazing that all this stuff is here
14249, NOTFUNNY, ### so the long term perspective goes out the window
3059, NOTFUNNY, ### so the first step get to the children get to the mothers and then follow up with family planning
3682, NOTFUNNY, ### trust me
14496, NOTFUNNY, ### i don't know if you realize but each of us has miles of blood vessels in our bodies miles

12655, FUNNY, ### and then my all time favorite word at this vote which is multi

5176, FUNNY, ### yup we really do this
4629, FUNNY, ### is that a problem i made a booking and weeks later my friend chris and my mom drove me out to the airport all pounds of me covered in a plaster body cast in a baggy pair of overalls
9741, FUNNY, ### a friend of mine who thought gay pride was getting very carried away with itself once suggested that we organize gay humility week
2699, FUNNY, ### i opened it up to find a small stuffed animal
8781, NOTFUNNY, ### and so i'm watching him and he slows down and finally he stops
4984, NOTFUNNY, ### it's called being true to yourself

9892, FUNNY, ### even these pictures and postcards of my london semester abroad years ago show that i obviously didn't care if i was perceived as weird or different
15508, NOTFUNNY, ### this amazing person muriel cooper
56, NOTFUNNY, ### and if you're wondering somebody actually did the experiment where they cut off the olfactory sense of the squirrels and they could still find their nuts
15144, NOTFUNNY, ### you could do the whole thing with addition
3272, NOTFUNNY, ### and also the easiest one was when i was doing it in form of a music
9973, FUNNY, ### i mean one day we would say and people were like foxes trotting
10486, NOTFUNNY, ### and so crick and i you know started building models and i'd learned a little chemistry but not enough
6055, FUNNY, ### and it's working beautifully
5392, NOTFUNNY, ### we say it's really amazing to travel and it's amazing to get to work with creative inspired passionate people
2844, NOTFUNNY, ### you know i think that allowing somebody one mere person to believe that he or she is like the vessel you know like the font and the essence and the source of all divine creative unknowable eternal mystery is just a too much responsibility to put on one fragile human psyche
1459, NOTFUNNY, ### which means yes i have a little shame no i'm a sociopath
6977, NOTFUNNY, ### and i thought about death a lot
14735, FUNNY, ### now look at what happens at the very end of this
2208, NOTFUNNY, ### laughter really is carbonated holiness
11774, FUNNY, ### and it goes like this
10993, NOTFUNNY, ### he always always treated each of us you know equally unbearably during the class
5297, NOTFUNNY, ### one i want to speak as early in the morning as possible
2428, FUNNY, ### and if you fall asleep which is very possible because it's been a long day you're going to be transported to the parking lot
7178, FUNNY, ### why i mean if i'm a good i've got to believe there's a reason for that
2382, FUNNY, ### you've all done it
9920, NOTFUNNY, ### a cure whichever it is will have to deal with the whole of me
7613, FUNNY, ### so i'd like to end on sort of a wacky note
6543, FUNNY, ### so a huge problem
13217, NOTFUNNY, ### i felt the abs kick in and the car is still going and it's not going to stop and i know it's not going to stop and the air bag deploys the car is totaled and fortunately no one was hurt
7828, FUNNY, ### it's like a barbie foot under this
13796, FUNNY, ### that'll keep bull elephants out i promise
2573, NOTFUNNY, ### so they attach the audio file at the bottom of the email so you can listen to double check
14875, NOTFUNNY, ### not much has happened
3024, FUNNY, ### now as i've gone around the world talking about this and telling this story in all sorts of organizations and companies people have seen the relevance almost instantly and they come up and they say things to me like that that's my company
12417, FUNNY, ### mainly because no one's ever asked them before
14501, FUNNY, ### you get started maybe a little slowly but you get enough done in the first week that with some heavier days later on everything gets done things stay civil
14088, FUNNY, ### losing concentration
3020, FUNNY, ### so right now i feel more like these are my principles and if you don't like them i have others
8764, NOTFUNNY, ### but by the time we turn we will have all exchanged the neurons we were born with in that structure with adult born neurons
1160, FUNNY, ### so i was faced with the dilemma to either never update my phone or never play bird again
1218, FUNNY, ### you can see it by looking at my head
361, NOTFUNNY, ### i think it's a little girl
7203, NOTFUNNY, ### but if we're going to talk about human well being we are of necessity talking about the human brain
12395, FUNNY, ### so when the bill passed we them back thank you for supporting the bill
11238, NOTFUNNY, ### this is a collective and conscious evolution
6012, NOTFUNNY, ### ah ah ah like that
5121, NOTFUNNY, ### originally you had the most complex societies the hunter gatherer village
10623, NOTFUNNY, ### now of course this does not mean that we should all stop collaborating and case in point is steve wozniak famously coming together with steve jobs to start apple computer but it does mean that solitude matters and that for some people it is the air that they breathe
13882, FUNNY, ### you could never get a permit to dump this in the ocean and it's coming out all from it
8416, FUNNY, ### what happened i lost million dollars
2614, NOTFUNNY, ### i'm interpreting it in a more contemporary manner
4489, FUNNY, ### and of course they couldn't have been because it's in the wrong spot
1425, NOTFUNNY, ### and my head was swooning over that overcooked piece of delicious fish i had the night before
8103, FUNNY, ### one it freed our five kids from following in our steps our shadow they don't know what i do
518, NOTFUNNY, ### we see it on all over the place
4941, NOTFUNNY, ### so it would be very expensive
6172, FUNNY, ### and the guy who is working there with them he's from maharashtra he said i think he's after the
10788, NOTFUNNY, ### so let me now apply this to a current controversy not because i want to advocate any particular solution but just to illustrate the kind of thing i mean
9113, NOTFUNNY, ### so we took the commission
13748, FUNNY, ### so now when you think about this what we have here is a ham butt problem
12403, NOTFUNNY, ### and i've collaborated with so many incredible inspirational musicians around the world
9315, NOTFUNNY, ### but smallpox was the fourth disease that was intended for eradication
2480, FUNNY, ### no one is closer to chancellor merkel than the swiss diplomats
10289, NOTFUNNY, ### so the same kids who are working in the gang were actually at the very same time typically working part time at a place like mcdonald's
10584, FUNNY, ### when it's degrees below zero
8516, NOTFUNNY, ### my favorite by jones is whatever else it might do it will touch your soul
12851, FUNNY, ### people would yell at me from their cars
10725, NOTFUNNY, ### as a country gets richer it invests more and more in getting more and more surplus into its shops and restaurants and as you can see most european and north american countries fall between and percent of the nutritional requirements of their populations
668, NOTFUNNY, ### everest
15574, NOTFUNNY, ### so there better be a nine at the beginning of my death number
1563, NOTFUNNY, ### and while some of them can be difficult there's no attempt to cure them
5130, NOTFUNNY, ### more and more it's possible for grassroots hatred abroad to manifest itself in the form of organized violence on american soil
1766, FUNNY, ### or at least i wrote an essay and then i wrote a book called bad feminist and then in interviews people started calling me the bad feminist
9231, NOTFUNNY, ### but it turns out that something can be invisible and still be numerically significant because with the right algorithms we can take this silent seemingly still video and we can recover this sound
7210, FUNNY, ### al gore made presentations in the house and the senate as an expert witness
8540, FUNNY, ### as for me disillusioned by the failed religion of my youth i went to america and became a berkeley hippie
2486, FUNNY, ### please send a drone strike
9553, FUNNY, ### and you keep going all the way to the top
2898, NOTFUNNY, ### i call this process flash sonar
11439, NOTFUNNY, ### they provide opportunities to be more physically active as well as local economic development
7008, NOTFUNNY, ### i realized that my story stood in for all those who were expected to pick themselves up by their bootstraps even if they didn't have any boots that my organization stood in for all the structural systemic help that never went to harlem or appalachia or the lower ward that my voice stood in for all those voices that seemed too too unwashed too
8923, FUNNY, ### here's ramon looking for a little attention from dad that week
646, NOTFUNNY, ### the reason for that is that these characters are actually not real characters
12658, FUNNY, ### they then have as the second definition skim and next to that they say usage problem
3312, FUNNY, ### to me the irony about the story is hearing about the engineers who had bought cheap small electronic calculators in japan that they used to double check their calculators
1359, FUNNY, ### anyway there isn't
15425, NOTFUNNY, ### many political reasons
6037, NOTFUNNY, ### so it's still modulated by this social context
8590, NOTFUNNY, ### that's the kind of power we have because of all of the data that we have
6994, NOTFUNNY, ### so we call this table
14123, NOTFUNNY, ### this is a site located in the eastern egyptian delta called mendes
8959, NOTFUNNY, ### we got behind it ourselves we changed our logo for the day from the alien to splashy to help the cause
10219, FUNNY, ### my responsibility is to get you home rich
10208, FUNNY, ### and i was reminded how utterly wrong i am so much of the time
7633, FUNNY, ### you know research
5553, NOTFUNNY, ### and ed witten unleashed the second revolution
1105, NOTFUNNY, ### and somehow to this day i frankly don't know how he was so aware of what was going on in the world but by inviting me to sit down with him when i was only a few years old and playing records in this by mozart and he would tell me how mozart was the most romantic of all the classic composers ever and how claire de which was one of his favorites was a real exposure to me to classical music
812, FUNNY, ### when i looked up two guys were seated three were lying down and others were squatting
892, NOTFUNNY, ### because you know when you look at a piece of music for example if i just open my little motorbike bag we have here hopefully a piece of music that is full of little black dots on the page
15543, FUNNY, ### the distance from abraham lincoln to a lincoln penny to penny marshall to the marshall plan to plan to nine lives it's all the same
5345, FUNNY, ### and i want to get one of these
448, FUNNY, ### so you'd just see her feet
2846, FUNNY, ### if you look at these two eye contact facing each other possibly both talking at the same time
3632, NOTFUNNY, ### you could dig as much as you want
4601, FUNNY, ### immediately death sweat
5764, FUNNY, ### it had to have a rider and it had to participate in cavalry charges
7981, NOTFUNNY, ### if you compare how did against how john kerry had done four years earlier democrats really like seeing this transition here where almost every state becomes bluer becomes more democratic even states lost like out west those states became more blue
10752, FUNNY, ### great creativity can spread tolerance champion freedom make education seem like a bright idea
11209, FUNNY, ### let's be honest guys you haven't got that cash
10386, FUNNY, ### and then my aunt frances dies and before she died she tried to pay with low packets for her bagel
12450, FUNNY, ### and according to them this creates an artificial lung in the filter
5341, FUNNY, ### but no compliments
13476, NOTFUNNY, ### never have we had numbers this high
1057, FUNNY, ### here's running up the
7699, FUNNY, ### now the reveal moment the subject is this person
2372, FUNNY, ### you're like hey a free story and you end up buying the product because the product and the story go together
3913, FUNNY, ### and failing
6820, FUNNY, ### this little chap here he stood there for five minutes motionless
2975, FUNNY, ### or lots of masks
2821, FUNNY, ### we kill them
12591, NOTFUNNY, ### now we have multi language instantaneous automatic translation services available for free via many of our devices all the way down to
5350, NOTFUNNY, ### and it arrived and it was tiny
7392, FUNNY, ### instead apparently the egyptian government used a free demo version of software
1810, NOTFUNNY, ### and for this one i want to tell you a quick story
1342, NOTFUNNY, ### pharaoh had his slaves move millions of blocks just to this site to erect a big freaking headstone
1501, NOTFUNNY, ### ten small bowls of pasta with a different spaghetti sauce on each one
5728, FUNNY, ### and we looked around and somebody else said well you should sell supplies to the working buccaneer
12301, NOTFUNNY, ### why are we talking about here you see a graph showing you the different types of crops that are being considered for making so you can see some things like soybean which makes gallons per acre per year or sunflower or canola or or palm and that tall graph there shows what can contribute
13024, NOTFUNNY, ### and when we look at the reason for poor quality water you find that it is our abysmal attitude to the disposal of human waste
11936, FUNNY, ### in the mornings it is terrible and the afternoon is worst
112, NOTFUNNY, ### he was so depressed that friends worried he was suicidal
8072, FUNNY, ### and you'd run a long cord into the house where you could screw it into your light socket
1526, NOTFUNNY, ### vast wealth can disappear tomorrow
13026, FUNNY, ### and few things give me greater joy than a well designed flag
558, FUNNY, ### now if you think i'm exaggerating at all in this all you have to do is substitute something else like indonesian
12799, NOTFUNNY, ### now ballet requires an extraordinary level of expertise and a high level of skill and probably a level of initial suitability that may well have a genetic component to it
6527, NOTFUNNY, ### stories are the antidote to bias
8513, NOTFUNNY, ### you just didn't want to respond to that person that time
10102, FUNNY, ### for women housework prevents breast cancer but for men shopping could make you impotent
1554, FUNNY, ### and his mother told me this story of coming home one day and he went to college nearby and she said i saw that car which you can always recognize in the parking lot of a bar she said
4113, FUNNY, ### so bright guy could be wrong on that one i don't know
13901, NOTFUNNY, ### and he wrote a story basically saying this is all well and good but you know we don't know squat about brains and no one has a clue how they work so don't believe what anyone tells you
2818, FUNNY, ### here in this box i have a cage with several hundred hungry female mosquitoes
8660, NOTFUNNY, ### it's rich it tastes good it feels good it smells good
7014, FUNNY, ### you can watch me for one minute now and you'll see the whole thing
12687, FUNNY, ### eventually i realized that i had really no content that i could count on so i decided to move towards packaging
11292, FUNNY, ### go rob other people linguists call this borrowing but we never give the words back so i'm just going to be honest and call it stealing
15598, FUNNY, ### we heard from a man out of zimbabwe who after hearing about created a husband school
5981, FUNNY, ### and then suing the state of texas and its governor rick perry to prevent them from executing stroman exactly like most people shot in the face do
5206, NOTFUNNY, ### it meant for the first time i could read back what i had typed into it
7149, FUNNY, ### they pointed out that i believe it was between and years from today they will be steering cars by wire without all that mechanical stuff
12454, NOTFUNNY, ### but i didn't want you to miss out on this one because this well it's called portion controlled meat cuts
2402, NOTFUNNY, ### now in the nature area we look at whether or not we are innately equipped with something perhaps in our brains some abnormal chromosome that causes this muse like effect
5694, FUNNY, ### later when this chapter appeared in our textbooks our biology teacher skipped the subject
1670, NOTFUNNY, ### that was the subject of the will smith movie concussion
6762, NOTFUNNY, ### so if you're going to talk about jobs then you have to talk about entrepreneurs
4620, FUNNY, ### i mean after all we're not trees and most of us are not lobsters
14239, NOTFUNNY, ### we lived under apartheid regime
8111, NOTFUNNY, ### and the average age of the first people who adhered were of course
8291, NOTFUNNY, ### and the fundamental reason i think why we feel that aging is inevitable is summed up in a definition of aging that i'm giving here
13764, NOTFUNNY, ### but through a combination of luck and the persistence of several generations of researchers this study has survived
5632, NOTFUNNY, ### this means that quantum theory has got to be in some sense true
4995, FUNNY, ### there was a little local difficulty in some of our minor colonies but
201, FUNNY, ### and it allows us to organize the entire dewey decimal system on one continuous run no matter how it grows or contracts within the building it will always have its clarity to end the sort of trail of tears that we've all experienced in public libraries
11077, NOTFUNNY, ### people have this belief and i share most of it that we will be using the tv screens or their equivalents for electronic books of the future
9775, FUNNY, ### it was a long held ambition of mine to bring down a statistics website due to public demand
14076, FUNNY, ### perhaps overlooked invention of the battery for the first time also demonstrated the utility of a professor
221, FUNNY, ### and as things are a little easier in india the site was purchased within a week and we were working
872, NOTFUNNY, ### but that's not happening here
613, NOTFUNNY, ### and then there was a second level to this object which is that it i wanted it to convey some proportions that i was interested in which is the diameter of the moon and the diameter of the earth in proportion to each other
14853, NOTFUNNY, ### he's a para athlete right now
2195, NOTFUNNY, ### but they wrote a paper about this and everybody in the western world began using electricity to people who were either schizophrenic or severely depressed
8613, NOTFUNNY, ### or and this is the fun part for me we want you to take us out into the natural world
3003, NOTFUNNY, ### and they are in our backyard
14191, FUNNY, ### oh
5260, FUNNY, ### so this is as joy mountford once said the mouse is probably the narrowest straw you could try to suck all of human expression through
4580, FUNNY, ### this is my poor son patrick
12810, FUNNY, ### and then courtesy of fox business news they called the concept the old intern
639, FUNNY, ### and again if you move the obstacle a tiny bit it'll again fall differently
2159, FUNNY, ### i like them young male unmarried slightly pissed off
4429, NOTFUNNY, ### when we put vaccines into people we are putting unnatural things into their body because we think the benefit outweighs the risk
10005, FUNNY, ### none of your media got it right
5237, NOTFUNNY, ### some people say happiness is right now it's the quality of the freshness of the present moment
7118, FUNNY, ### wow you are really normal
13948, NOTFUNNY, ### now symmetry is almost nature's language
4507, NOTFUNNY, ### women live in the and every single day and these women brought that to this mission as well
7540, FUNNY, ### woman i would make a spear that when you went deep sea diving you could catch the fish really fast and then roll it back up and you could swim easier
13099, FUNNY, ### small stuff stinks but of course it's essential right what else planning is incredibly important
5839, FUNNY, ### i said i'd be there in about two years
6656, FUNNY, ### i have work to do
13295, FUNNY, ### so you could drive up into the mountains freely blasting the police on the new sony walkman
12981, FUNNY, ### well that's when all hell broke loose
2733, NOTFUNNY, ### aspirations are rising as never before because of access to the internet
2430, NOTFUNNY, ### some of the objects are a glass of water a coat a shoe a rose
12747, NOTFUNNY, ### we have a split wing
15286, NOTFUNNY, ### i'm working with a young computer animator named nick deamer and this is a little demo that he's done for me part of a larger project some of you may be interested in
4031, NOTFUNNY, ### now just so you don't think this is normal that over there is sweden
404, NOTFUNNY, ### they're not going to die of hypothermia
3669, NOTFUNNY, ### but it was really about the fact that i was looking for a project on my own and there was no open source really on my radar at all
6795, FUNNY, ### people have been using this for all kinds of fun purposes
2677, NOTFUNNY, ### so we could easily supply the world with dozens maybe hundreds of new cities
12795, NOTFUNNY, ### and the crypto theme is thought this one thing was going to happen and something else happened instead
6073, NOTFUNNY, ### it won't and it never did
14752, NOTFUNNY, ### there's actually a lot of evidence in primates and other animals that they return favors
6312, NOTFUNNY, ### and i kind of got a handle on it
2933, NOTFUNNY, ### and i think things like the dark net markets creative secure difficult to censor i think that's the future
12124, FUNNY, ### okay now i don't want to alarm anybody in this room but it's just come to my attention that the person to your right is a liar
10656, NOTFUNNY, ### and i couldn't choose airplanes because they had gotten sort of at that point even though i'd done a lot of airplane work on the interiors
10983, NOTFUNNY, ### not only of course the scientists and all the wonderful giants of the industries but the celebrities
6960, FUNNY, ### next these guys very similar community that's extremely conducive to innovation
8939, FUNNY, ### freedom if you're from new hampshire
3060, NOTFUNNY, ### so we said let's do it
1072, FUNNY, ### i was the most popular person online
1921, NOTFUNNY, ### and my uncle he would look me in the eyes and he would say to me vida
13606, NOTFUNNY, ### in a period of time of just three years from to he had conceived theorized designed passed and gotten ratified the us constitution
144, NOTFUNNY, ### nor am i going to talk about what i think are obvious statements from my first book silicon snake oil or my second book nor am i going to talk about why i believe computers don't belong in schools
9159, NOTFUNNY, ### and yet it's not included in our cultural perception of physics and that bothers me
2346, NOTFUNNY, ### well it turns out all of the three beliefs are wrong
15555, NOTFUNNY, ### what i'm searching for is a durable mutation that's what all of us are searching for
2474, NOTFUNNY, ### people don't realize that
8975, NOTFUNNY, ### we are complex individuals swirls of contradiction
10119, NOTFUNNY, ### you can give the competing drug in too high a dose so people get side effects
14846, NOTFUNNY, ### but above all who would have to be wrong the perpetrators
4749, NOTFUNNY, ### i feel god's love when i'm hurt and confused and i feel consoled and cared for
10273, FUNNY, ### and especially for me as i sat in my office with my excel spreadsheet open waiting for to come and deliver to me the latest load of data that he would get from the gang
8418, FUNNY, ### one don't build a reformer on a fault
1586, NOTFUNNY, ### the second law is a law of humility if you like
2251, FUNNY, ### when we zoom in on the number of articles just investigating breast milk we see that we know much more about coffee wine and tomatoes
12791, NOTFUNNY, ### it means that you think that your beliefs just perfectly reflect reality
7491, NOTFUNNY, ### come right over here next to me
15175, NOTFUNNY, ### and if we had a computer that could detect it we could tell you you're having a heart attack so early it could save your life and prevent congestive heart failure
12885, NOTFUNNY, ### i could see vividly i suppose being filmed out of the door of a helicopter there was kind of rock music playing in the background and i had a ski pole with a union jack you know flying in the wind
12214, NOTFUNNY, ### and then the other one percent is eagerly looking for the formula to apply in that situation
9002, FUNNY, ### yeah
3253, NOTFUNNY, ### every morning again after getting out of that tent your brain is completely wiped out
10739, NOTFUNNY, ### some of you might be thinking that's a lot of time to spend playing games
5101, NOTFUNNY, ### my wife's just finished writing a novel and i think it's a great book but she disappears for hours on end
7559, NOTFUNNY, ### so that was the six we had for you today but i hope you're starting to see why we find these things so fascinating
14312, NOTFUNNY, ### since i joined in misogyny and have amply demonstrated they will dog my every step
10260, NOTFUNNY, ### go
12961, NOTFUNNY, ### according to the california department of corrections over percent of those incarcerated have committed or have been charged with money related crimes robberies burglaries fraud larceny extortion and the list goes on
4788, FUNNY, ### it's something that since it was invented a year or two ago has given me untold happiness
13967, NOTFUNNY, ### nick just left on a business trip and heather is playing on his with the boys when she sees a message appear on the screen can't wait to see you
2706, FUNNY, ### here is the orange one
5994, FUNNY, ### all hail visicalc new york times all hail visicalc
3321, FUNNY, ### and i still feel i'm running it's just the training to become a long distance
9226, FUNNY, ### so this experiment looks completely ridiculous
10735, FUNNY, ### first of all for children in the united states hours is the exact amount of time you will spend in school from fifth grade to high school graduation if you have perfect attendance
923, FUNNY, ### and say these are good ones
6414, FUNNY, ### but the bird instead of flying away goes flop flop flop and lands on my head
9402, FUNNY, ### and at every day it doesn't matter who you're emailing or what you're doing the desks rise to the ceiling
12522, FUNNY, ### then i don't look it but i was the indian national squash champion for three years
7383, NOTFUNNY, ### we collected jars of peanut butter and over valentine's day cards
14732, FUNNY, ### this is me at an early age with a baby chimpanzee
15385, NOTFUNNY, ### so if you brush up against it any place you brushed against it you get this twinkling blue green light that's just breathtaking
9986, FUNNY, ### first of all why do they have such a bad press when charles darwin went across the atlantic in on the beagle he saw the turkey vulture and he said these are disgusting birds with bald scarlet heads that are formed to revel in
10071, NOTFUNNY, ### because especially people you've known a long time people you've spent time with i can see the spiritual essence inside them the tenderness the vulnerability
11929, NOTFUNNY, ### i'm an industrial engineer
12236, FUNNY, ### and two weeks after this drawing was done we actually had our first project contract at on robotic cockroaches which was very frightening to me
14834, NOTFUNNY, ### so rather than have it fight or do industrial work we decided to build a planter put the robot into the center of it and we called it the
14888, FUNNY, ### but i was happy to pay it because for every blow that i received i was able to deliver two
4842, NOTFUNNY, ### so i'm going to talk to the baby
10849, NOTFUNNY, ### we were folding up a lot of folding chairs and i was amazed at how quickly we found our own rhythm
4872, NOTFUNNY, ### although women were then coming out of the universities with decent degrees there was a glass ceiling to our progress
15092, NOTFUNNY, ### now that i suggest is the view that comes out of taking seriously
12605, NOTFUNNY, ### it just doesn't work
50, FUNNY, ### so the next morning when i woke up on too little sleep worrying about the hole in the window and a mental note that i had to call my contractor and the freezing temperatures and the meetings i had upcoming in europe and you know with all the in my brain my thinking was cloudy but i didn't know it was cloudy because my thinking was cloudy
4760, NOTFUNNY, ### but all i have to do is fill certain areas of those and i can bring those words out of the background pattern
13220, FUNNY, ### okay thanks
15107, NOTFUNNY, ### we go through initiation rites
14780, FUNNY, ### we all heard you pee
14549, NOTFUNNY, ### it's rarely color that i find in nature although you know juxtaposed next to artificial color natural color is so beautiful
7921, NOTFUNNY, ### beyond the physical landscape of our planet some of the most famous celestial images are of intersections
4575, NOTFUNNY, ### put that aside
8137, FUNNY, ### the says i give smokers a discount because not as much to tell
1140, FUNNY, ### and while these are both wonderful things in their own right they both have very wonderful things going for them truth and beauty as ideals that can be looked at by the sciences and by math are almost like the ideal conjoined twins that a scientist would want to date
9368, FUNNY, ### now i had tried to imagine what could possibly be in an animated tv commercial featuring tom arnold that would get you to get in your car drive across town and buy a roast beef sandwich
10873, NOTFUNNY, ### but it is even more remarkable if you consider where we had been just a few years ago
1076, NOTFUNNY, ### so that wasn't going to work
7754, FUNNY, ### look i do think we have to recognize my fellow campers that when you are being chased by the bear in the global context you need not outrun the bear you need to only outrun your fellow campers
15414, NOTFUNNY, ### its a toy its called a finger blaster
5037, FUNNY, ### she didn't even have a boyfriend
7626, NOTFUNNY, ### and they kill lions
3351, NOTFUNNY, ### and his girlfriend is probably not very happy about him either
11408, FUNNY, ### my mother and i can be competitive but i was really not trying to compete with her on this one
10922, NOTFUNNY, ### it's a fantastic example of how technology is creating a market for things that never had a marketplace before
12634, NOTFUNNY, ### they said no
5927, NOTFUNNY, ### older people can view injustice with compassion but not despair
13136, FUNNY, ### because it suggests we should do something
11860, FUNNY, ### so you go to the literature
8767, FUNNY, ### no one's laughing
13133, FUNNY, ### she said they don't want like the angry black man
12069, NOTFUNNY, ### loneliness isn't the only psychological wound that distorts our perceptions and misleads us
6442, FUNNY, ### is the most common term
10928, FUNNY, ### he said two interesting things a teacher that can be replaced by a machine should be
8241, FUNNY, ### if i had a little extra money i'd buy a hostess fruit pie
6530, NOTFUNNY, ### but you didn't
14391, NOTFUNNY, ### it is a moment in time
11120, NOTFUNNY, ### and something which maybe you don't like but you are so hungry that you really will be satisfied to eat
133, NOTFUNNY, ### and you might say it's about the reverse engineering of religions
4598, FUNNY, ### i would run into the living room jump up on the couch rip the cushions off throw them on the floor scream at the top of my lungs and run out because i was the incredible hulk
15053, NOTFUNNY, ### and that's before we actually tried to deliver it to the home
8268, FUNNY, ### can you imagine of course my brothers were not happy about it and later i noticed they were not there whenever i needed them
8035, NOTFUNNY, ### this is my supermarket
4547, NOTFUNNY, ### we were crazy about music
6828, FUNNY, ### that's extremely unlikely
6247, NOTFUNNY, ### that's another story we won't even get into
12693, NOTFUNNY, ### i had to figure it out because along with the invitation came the frightening reminder that there would be no projector so bringing those would no longer be necessary but some alternate form of communication would
14862, FUNNY, ### it was the brutal realization the first morning that the indian students were better than me
10632, FUNNY, ### but sometimes i try to put myself in that position
11666, NOTFUNNY, ### so as a result of that and feeling rejected i went back to the base and i talked to the squadron commander
9725, NOTFUNNY, ### basically things only professionals know
13815, NOTFUNNY, ### we have confused hierarchy of needs just a little bit
7623, NOTFUNNY, ### and one of the reasons why he designed roofs this way is because it's he found it fascinating that you could build such a strong structure that's made of so few materials and can be supported by so few points
2098, NOTFUNNY, ### we did the transcontinental railroad the marshall plan
2469, FUNNY, ### would you describe it as a whirlwind romance no no no
10009, NOTFUNNY, ### but in at the height of the sub prime and all the complicated financial structures it was quite opposite to the reckless risk taking behaviors that we saw on the market
4442, NOTFUNNY, ### and none of this pin stuff would have happened if it hadn't been for saddam hussein
11173, NOTFUNNY, ### he was there alone drinking and she was with friends
4140, NOTFUNNY, ### why because that's what we need
13276, FUNNY, ### it's so complicated
6861, FUNNY, ### this flower with its black dots they might look like black dots to us but if i tell you to a male insect of the right species that looks like two females who are really really hot to trot
3327, NOTFUNNY, ### so each window is an image and is a world that i often revisit
13522, FUNNY, ### and so arthur benjamin did a little of the same thing
3709, NOTFUNNY, ### the radiologists were in turn criticized for protecting their own financial self interest
5053, FUNNY, ### when the tomatoes were nice and ripe and red overnight some hippos came out from the river and they ate everything
9704, NOTFUNNY, ### they go into the city
791, FUNNY, ### i her
12748, FUNNY, ### probably not yet maybe in the future
2835, FUNNY, ### so when i heard that i was like that's uncanny that's exactly what my creative process is like
12133, NOTFUNNY, ### sometimes we're willing participants in deception for the sake of social dignity maybe to keep a secret that should be kept secret secret
6188, FUNNY, ### and watch you're going to see another south african crime taking place right now
2087, NOTFUNNY, ### he is not a loser though he has lost
4064, FUNNY, ### and there's the fountain

14914, NOTFUNNY, ### we want to go in a direction but the winds push us in another direction like in life
10888, NOTFUNNY, ### but i wanted to elaborate on a couple of these
12807, NOTFUNNY, ### a hot gas is producing emission lines only no continuum
3769, NOTFUNNY, ### we're waiting for the psychics to come forth and snap at it
14177, FUNNY, ### what does this mean this means that as we go to sleep at night all of us in the last seconds before we drift off to sleep our final thought should be i'm glad that ireland exists
10766, NOTFUNNY, ### and the audience for such a long time was in a position where they didn't have any way of affecting news or making any change
6946, NOTFUNNY, ### some people say the secret to happiness is low expectations
686, NOTFUNNY, ### let me remind you what we already know
9222, NOTFUNNY, ### we've created a non profit urban model based on the science of livestock mortality composting that turns human beings into soil
12147, NOTFUNNY, ### well i'm really excited today to show you the newest version of a robot using a new hierarchical dry adhesive
15470, FUNNY, ### now picture yourself in a driverless car in the year sitting back and watching this vintage video
11332, FUNNY, ### the yellow box was called the administration complex
6351, FUNNY, ### the one on the left is jazz and the one on the right is swing but you know what this is a highly useless categorization scheme
8294, FUNNY, ### public singing whole different thing
3344, FUNNY, ### some of you may want the toilet paper with the most bleach in it rather than the most ecologically responsible choice
5441, NOTFUNNY, ### percent of all the people in the world get half of their drinking water from that melting flow
5103, NOTFUNNY, ### and doing that i think is the answer to the future because it's not about scaling a new solution it's about creating a movement in education in which people develop their own solutions but with external support based on a personalized curriculum
595, FUNNY, ### three days later it faded and a week later no more complaining anywhere
12588, NOTFUNNY, ### corporate profits are quite high in fact if you include bank profits they're higher than they've ever been
12728, FUNNY, ### so and the best thing is they paid off and the check didn't bounce
10037, NOTFUNNY, ### you need to have integrity as part of your bones and your as an organization because if you don't you'll be unable to build trust and trust is a sine qua non of this new network world
1794, FUNNY, ### i was trying to remind myself of the simple universal little pleasures that we all love but we just don't talk about enough things like waiters and waitresses who bring you free refills without asking being the first table to get called up to the dinner buffet at a wedding wearing warm underwear from just out of the dryer or when cashiers open up a new check out lane at the grocery store and you get to be first in line even if you were last at the other line swoop right in there
14092, NOTFUNNY, ### or when you overeat because your feelings are hurt or whatever
9206, NOTFUNNY, ### i had to be adaptable like carly and evolve my skills my mindset and my circumstances and then i had to be resilient like stefano and resurrect myself and my career like a phoenix from the ashes
13906, NOTFUNNY, ### this is one too because when we understand how brains work we'll be able to build intelligent machines
2404, NOTFUNNY, ### and then i also wasn't really shining in a certain area that i wanted to be and you know you look at those scores and it wasn't bad but it was not certainly predictive that i would one day make my living out of the artful arrangement of words
5002, FUNNY, ### so what is this hyperbolic geometry that corals and sea slugs embody the next few minutes is we're all going to get raised up to the level of a sea slug
7445, FUNNY, ### now you can see how easy it is for me to manipulate the human mind once you know how
5799, FUNNY, ### not moose but water
8905, FUNNY, ### what we're really good at is basically wasting time
2986, NOTFUNNY, ### it is transparent made just for you
2924, FUNNY, ### hundreds of people send their into one address they're tumbled and jumbled up and then the right amount is sent on to the right recipients but they're different micro laundering systems
12809, NOTFUNNY, ### and we use this weak feature to measure the composition of gold in the atmosphere of the sun
11390, FUNNY, ### this is what happens to the people in miami who are looking up
9950, FUNNY, ### let's talk about dentists vasectomies guns and shark attacks
2072, FUNNY, ### even though she is much richer than any of you are and she's got a very large house the reason why we don't envy her is because she's too weird
12570, FUNNY, ### again none of this is new that's why shakespeare and the stoics were telling us this centuries ago but shakespeare never had to face emails in a day
9408, NOTFUNNY, ### what's really interesting about the school is that percent of the kids who go there have parents who are high level silicon valley tech execs
6933, FUNNY, ### we have to recognize they're different from us
2603, FUNNY, ### they don't look like losers to me
1477, NOTFUNNY, ### now i said i have over a decade of demonizing stress to redeem myself from so we are going to do one more intervention
8154, FUNNY, ### coughs yeah
11788, FUNNY, ### now i happen to completely agree with the optimism of this first quote because on a scale of zero to morgan freeman's voice it happens to be one of the most evocative accolades that i've heard come our way
11030, FUNNY, ### sorry about this jeff
12290, NOTFUNNY, ### this is a portrait of my daughter and myself
3358, NOTFUNNY, ### three hundred and fifty thousand people a day walk through times square and people had tried for years to make changes
11990, FUNNY, ### i'll take your picture just for trying
9350, FUNNY, ### given the tone of the coverage you'd think that we had decided to shut down the and go home
11192, FUNNY, ### they stopped using oxygen pretty quickly
15041, NOTFUNNY, ### and today we have in vietnam the same life expectancy and the same family size here in vietnam as in united states by the end of the war
3487, FUNNY, ### in ireland the obvious choice is the military but to be honest it actually kind of sucks
3624, FUNNY, ### em yeah
6632, FUNNY, ### but what that tombstone should have said in an alternative lifetime what it should have said if it was your highest expression of talent was here lies the last nobel laureate in physics who formulated the grand unified field theory and demonstrated the practicality of warp drive
1902, FUNNY, ### but only one of them out of the said this
12216, FUNNY, ### get back into my body now
10619, NOTFUNNY, ### so if you picture the typical classroom nowadays when i was going to school we sat in rows
14970, NOTFUNNY, ### that's not true
176, NOTFUNNY, ### this is a picture from last summer when we traveled the coast again for seven weeks
13070, FUNNY, ### i only know two types of wine red and white
13395, NOTFUNNY, ### one sculpture became two

2847, NOTFUNNY, ### one definition of health may be that that chord is in complete harmony
2338, FUNNY, ### so let's do it
6400, FUNNY, ### and he turned to me and he said carne you have to be very clever to be a diplomat
15511, NOTFUNNY, ### and because of that i always wondered about this human thing
1614, FUNNY, ### for me law order tina fey and rock and judge judy the people are real the cases are real the rulings are final
4444, NOTFUNNY, ### but that's the least of it
8191, FUNNY, ### and i know a little bit about these issues because for many years i spent a long time in the non profit industrial complex and i'm a recovering executive director two years clean
4330, NOTFUNNY, ### and are the ones who drive the marketing and the hype and the and the brand cachet and enable nike to sell millions of sneakers
13726, FUNNY, ### i know you think of yourself as human beings but i think of you as or percent bacterial
13551, NOTFUNNY, ### these look in order i'm probably hopefully yeah
4034, FUNNY, ### the headline was nato admiral needs friends
5086, FUNNY, ### i mean there is a major climate crisis obviously and i think if people don't believe it they should get out more
14852, FUNNY, ### we're just scientists
14546, NOTFUNNY, ### it does not come for me from research
6489, FUNNY, ### my poor parents did not care if we were any good
7263, FUNNY, ### monkeys in the zoo
9601, FUNNY, ### they said these are pathological curves and we don't have to discuss them
4456, FUNNY, ### so what was the difference well the course i was and am teaching is called cellular and molecular neuroscience i
612, NOTFUNNY, ### the bronze is nice hard durable material that could roll on the ground
5000, NOTFUNNY, ### in fact in the average chinese was richer than the average north american

13752, NOTFUNNY, ### but what people really often think about the dictionary is they think more like this
12303, FUNNY, ### let's take a look
1046, NOTFUNNY, ### tiny little behavioral economics detail in italy penalty points go backwards
9559, NOTFUNNY, ### from outside it looks chaotic but everything is perfectly organized

4084, NOTFUNNY, ### and now that i have i want to give you a gift

6909, FUNNY, ### you don't even have to be jewish

13637, NOTFUNNY, ### in fact even if producing was good for the environment given that we're going to run out of hydrocarbons we need to find some sustainable means of operating
2360, NOTFUNNY, ### now here's a secret you probably know already your stories are constructed
13375, NOTFUNNY, ### play is the glue that binds us together
7967, NOTFUNNY, ### now four years ago i injured my foot in a climbing accident and i went to the doctor
628, NOTFUNNY, ### sometimes their parents would reject them siblings their own children and then their divorcing spouse would forbid them from seeing their children
9660, NOTFUNNY, ### while i can no longer remember what that argument was about i very clearly remember how i felt watching him leave

5910, FUNNY, ### and i'd get a terse response oh that's worse
9076, FUNNY, ### you know i looked at the map i picked out sites i figured no problem
1400, NOTFUNNY, ### the second piece of bad news will be delivered to you by who will tell you that if you are older than four or five years of age that even if you have your eye corrected the chances of your brain learning how to see are very very slim again slim or none
9869, FUNNY, ### and of course what's especially good is if you type design and emotion the first response out of those pages is my website
12754, FUNNY, ### but i still hate the smell
2211, NOTFUNNY, ### also the people will make you laugh out loud at the most inconvenient times and that's the great good news
6554, FUNNY, ### we had a two old baby in the house that was ours we hadn't taken it from somebody else

1506, NOTFUNNY, ### no you just get the reduction
154, NOTFUNNY, ### it is an imaginary super magnified medical device that fits around the optic nerve
2683, NOTFUNNY, ### and the trick that richard dawkins does which is to say to look at them as simply as genes as vehicles for genes
10020, FUNNY, ### then we can do something harder
7546, FUNNY, ### his company actually did a survey of firemen all across the country to try to learn how are they currently testing the air when they respond to an emergency scene and he kind of comically explained that time after time what the firemen would say is they would rush to the scene of the crime they would look around if there were no dead policemen it was ok to go
8579, FUNNY, ### and now i need to choose a sperm donor
14181, FUNNY, ### but what we call it is or research and develop it yourself
398, NOTFUNNY, ### please enjoy

8176, NOTFUNNY, ### i originally had opened the studio in new york to combine my two loves music and design
13949, NOTFUNNY, ### but on a larger scale of biology actually symmetry is very important because it actually communicates genetic information
8920, FUNNY, ### i should be able to ask my house where my shoes are
8214, FUNNY, ### that was like we considered that super cool
1176, FUNNY, ### thank you
7310, NOTFUNNY, ### and it weights those together into an attention window and it looks for the highest scoring place the stuff where the most interesting stuff is happening and that is what its eyes then segue to
8721, NOTFUNNY, ### so we worked with a design studio called habits in milan to make this mirror which is completely open source
6155, FUNNY, ### obviously they weren't paying attention
13822, FUNNY, ### if we let our desires melt away we'll see the world for what it truly is a nothingness and we'll slip into this happy state of nirvana which has been defined as having just enough life to enjoy being dead
8699, NOTFUNNY, ### but this is also the thing that brings the chaos back and this is second big innovation

5514, FUNNY, ### and of course we're all capable of understanding these symbols
15050, FUNNY, ### and sometimes we'll catch them on testimonial videos saying such things as they have more energy after the day to play with their grandchildren or in one case a guy said the zone is so stress free that i've actually stopped taking my blood pressure medication

9596, NOTFUNNY, ### medicine is doing a better job of keeping us alive
14054, FUNNY, ### we're too busy keeping out the giraffes putting the kids on the bus in the morning getting ourselves to work on time surviving email overload and shop floor politics foraging for groceries throwing together meals escaping for a couple of precious hours in the evening into prime time tv or ted online getting from one end of the day to the other keeping out the giraffes

15440, FUNNY, ### i've got issues
7166, NOTFUNNY, ### the way things are supposed to be
8293, NOTFUNNY, ### i wanted to collect more different types of eyes so i built this device using bicycle helmets some lightbulbs and television sets
9643, FUNNY, ### now she harbored all sorts of sentiments and emotions towards me at the time but love was not amongst them
13441, NOTFUNNY, ### first of all we have all the statistical analyses from the innocence project work where we know that we have what documented cases now where people have been wrongfully convicted and subsequently exonerated some from death row on the basis of later analysis and you know that over three quarters of all of those cases of exoneration involved only eyewitness identification testimony during the trial that convicted them
9083, FUNNY, ### the pilot made this great observation that's hot
15229, FUNNY, ### you were beaten by the chimps

14297, NOTFUNNY, ### i worried that there was something wrong with this and something wrong with me for being unable to stick with anything
13880, FUNNY, ### that's how they like to live
8433, NOTFUNNY, ### we've shown that you can actually reverse heart disease
15345, NOTFUNNY, ### but my real mentor in this journey of aging is olga murray
3781, NOTFUNNY, ### i'm sitting on a chair
2411, FUNNY, ### and so this morning i thought oh well i'll just do a card trick
11555, NOTFUNNY, ### large prime numbers are a great way of testing the speed and accuracy of computer chips
13444, FUNNY, ### you need three lessons and they need to be terribly profound
14114, NOTFUNNY, ### so we made this thing
12305, NOTFUNNY, ### he was hiding from the pitiful look in people's eyes
11884, FUNNY, ### add some lsd and some questionable wardrobe choices and the whole world could be like burning man
12916, FUNNY, ### and ok so you could sex it up and like go to a much more mac you know but really it's the kind of same old crap we've had for the last you know years
6783, NOTFUNNY, ### the point is the white pill is not as good as the blue pill is not as good as the capsule is not as good as the needle
12896, FUNNY, ### and we had an opportunity to try that out in a community in the central part of rio which is called santa marta and we made a design for this place which looked like this and then we got people to go along with it because turns out that if your idea is ridiculously big it's easier to get people to go along with this
11122, FUNNY, ### too many buildings that you see outside that are so banal tell you a story but the story is very short which says we have no story to tell you
2956, NOTFUNNY, ### i started to speak with the community and i could convince everybody and we could start to work
15260, NOTFUNNY, ### and there was some concern that in some parts of the country there might be voter suppression
4499, NOTFUNNY, ### and first i was praised for it then criticized for it but the fact of the matter was i had become solemn
14050, NOTFUNNY, ### this is an ancient partnership that we have just recently found out about
5374, NOTFUNNY, ### so i was so disturbed by what i saw and i was so unhappy with the article that ran afterwards that i decided i would take six months off
10362, FUNNY, ### if that belief turns out to be mistaken it will make a difference
2305, FUNNY, ### that's pretty tough for any male especially if you ride a bike
2367, FUNNY, ### when asked to describe their lives what is interesting is how few people said mess
7054, NOTFUNNY, ### and then what they did in october is they took skin cells turned them into stem cells and began to turn them into liver cells
1091, NOTFUNNY, ### but we're humans we're terrestrial mammals

1260, FUNNY, ### but i want you to do is also with your eyes is follow the colored ball that i ask you to follow
6167, NOTFUNNY, ### there is certainly no other earthly reason to do what they do except for pay

13544, FUNNY, ### just kidding warming up king of hearts
2278, NOTFUNNY, ### i'm going to instead in a minute or two show you an early crude video because i think it's a better way to tell a story

3690, FUNNY, ### and that it was such a shame that young americans were serial murderers
9954, FUNNY, ### think twice before you have that bottle of wine
12863, NOTFUNNY, ### and i got a lot of criticism online after my went big for continuing my crazy practices specifically for asking musicians who are fans if they wanted to join us on stage for a few songs in exchange for love and tickets and beer and this was a doctored image that went up of me on a website
8962, FUNNY, ### it's like santa claus without the seasonal restrictions
5686, FUNNY, ### you're going to have to fuck up really badly to make it bad
14913, NOTFUNNY, ### and i think that's one of the main problems of our society
14240, NOTFUNNY, ### they could sell these things for anything between a kilo
15409, FUNNY, ### because when we looked at the video when he got back we saw minutes of this
15331, NOTFUNNY, ### well i disagree
9372, FUNNY, ### these guys make the loudest car stereo in the world
256, FUNNY, ### i flip on the light and physically shake the poor boy awake because i know that like ripping off a band aid it's better to get it over with quickly
13404, NOTFUNNY, ### but before i do i just want to clarify which numbers i'm talking about here
3602, NOTFUNNY, ### and the situation it describes is the hero of the book he's a century man finds himself alone on a strange planet populated only by a technologically primitive people
9571, NOTFUNNY, ### and without democracy our societies will be nastier our future bleak and our great new technologies wasted
14144, NOTFUNNY, ### after surgeries for cancer took away my ability to speak eat or drink i was forced to enter this virtual world in which a computer does some of my living for me
6230, NOTFUNNY, ### so you have this odd sort of paradox where i'm happy for him to go into this space if i know who everybody else is but i don't want anybody else to know who he is
6267, FUNNY, ### she's a year older than me and that's something that if she's still playing i know i can play
792, NOTFUNNY, ### now in this discussion today i'm going to focus on a different aspect of
10929, FUNNY, ### as a result the teachers reported tremendous improvements in their english rapid improvement and all sorts of things
8422, NOTFUNNY, ### and one trillion of that goes to opec
2507, FUNNY, ### and now the trick is getting them back
9030, NOTFUNNY, ### that's how they printed them in the old bibles
2941, FUNNY, ### and i'm going to demonstrate for you
15108, NOTFUNNY, ### and you might think of this cultural web of life as being an and you might define the as being the sum total of all thoughts and dreams myths ideas inspirations brought into being by the human imagination since the dawn of consciousness
10713, FUNNY, ### you must be doing something right
3956, FUNNY, ### i was once late to my own speech on time management
5185, NOTFUNNY, ### so for that last years that's how we've been operating
5212, FUNNY, ### actually one indication is that little boy on my husband's shoulders has just graduated from high school
13682, FUNNY, ### why it's not called the hard problem of consciousness for nothing

167, NOTFUNNY, ### and that's the norwegian media in a nutshell not much drama
5660, NOTFUNNY, ### and then i did a law school for loyola in downtown l
12520, NOTFUNNY, ### and this piece those aren't actually leaves
15223, FUNNY, ### they are the arts and parenting
4662, FUNNY, ### in fact i think our airline took a full page ad at the time saying you know come on richard there are better ways of crossing the atlantic
5841, FUNNY, ### my sister said maybe i should leave you alone because you seem to be doing a lot better when not saying anything
373, NOTFUNNY, ### and as we search for the truth about government we should keep work not a lie but an allegory in our collective mind's eye
443, FUNNY, ### and if she doesn't well that's the story
6892, NOTFUNNY, ### all the time when they talk about it you immediately think about africa
1159, FUNNY, ### another time i was devastated because my favorite mobile game bird was being taken off the app store
1927, FUNNY, ### and actually like nick i brought samples
1406, FUNNY, ### there was a long pause on the line and he said there's just too much chicken in the world
502, FUNNY, ### com
9614, NOTFUNNY, ### you can draw as everyone should
8234, NOTFUNNY, ### and the brain scans were identical in both activities

14242, FUNNY, ### and she called poverty a personality defect
2594, NOTFUNNY, ### they were very important for the oil out of their liver
14433, NOTFUNNY, ### so i did
6568, NOTFUNNY, ### this is what they think about my site it's ranked by authority

15039, NOTFUNNY, ### we stopped the world then
7617, NOTFUNNY, ### the body flexes backwards just a spectacular movement
4699, FUNNY, ### you get the idea
12909, FUNNY, ### now i'm not talking here just about the bad companies the of the human soul as i call them
1313, NOTFUNNY, ### from urban planning and master planning to theater and all sorts of stuff
10344, FUNNY, ### so when i randomly ran down to the junior college and registered for classes i really wasn't paying attention to what i was registering to

4296, NOTFUNNY, ### and so what they typically do is they decide that all these people need to come together in one place to do that work
5658, FUNNY, ### and i was asked to do a fish and so i did a snake

5446, FUNNY, ### that could and wouldn't and i've had some that would and could
5881, NOTFUNNY, ### and of course that makes sense because hope is an abstract phenomenon it's an abstract idea it's not a concrete word
12914, NOTFUNNY, ### i then walked him up the hill to the local cafe and we shared a pizza for two then walked down the hill to our home and i gave him his bath and put him in his batman pajamas
6541, FUNNY, ### and turning around you is like that

6497, NOTFUNNY, ### but what you're talking about is even bigger than that
11198, NOTFUNNY, ### after five years it went away on its own
6139, FUNNY, ### we'll do app development radiological medicine yoga instruction

4229, NOTFUNNY, ### i was reading this list out loud to a friend and at first was laughing it was so ludicrous but i'd just gotten past mangled and my voice broke and i had to stop and collect myself from the emotional shock and impact that the assault from these words unleashed
2843, NOTFUNNY, ### which is great because the romans did not actually think that a genius was a particularly clever individual

6728, NOTFUNNY, ### yves uses his body to steer the wing
2037, FUNNY, ### but kim said that i was her ideal the heartbroken mess that i was

15060, NOTFUNNY, ### i believe in the concept of a yogi be a dude before you can become an ascetic
3824, FUNNY, ### the parachutes are there hopefully more for psychological than real reasons but they will be an ultimate backup if it comes to that

2755, FUNNY, ### so they're losing power losing power until finally they get to a point where hot water goes into their mouths and they cook from the inside out
8295, FUNNY, ### i sort of lived with this idea that when i'm grown i'll have learned to speak french and when i'm grown i'll learn how to manage my money and when i'm grown i won't have a stutter and then i'll be able to public speak and maybe be the prime minister and anything's possible and you know
10841, FUNNY, ### instead they were all how should i put it they were all kind of robotic
245, NOTFUNNY, ### jobs are being killed off
5756, FUNNY, ### and the other cool thing is not only can we move the camera around we can also control time so i can slide this jog dial here to shuttle time forward and now we can see what a sunset on the would look like and they get one every minutes
2319, NOTFUNNY, ### the other lesson that is rarely mastered is the art of fulfillment
14696, FUNNY, ### and so for many years i feared that my father would die before i had a chance to kill him
10949, NOTFUNNY, ### you can't catch me
5221, FUNNY, ### maybe we can try this at home someday i don't know

844, NOTFUNNY, ### soon after i finished running this experiment i went to talk to a big software company in seattle
2423, NOTFUNNY, ### now if we do this i believe we can go back years and start agency social engineering back into architecture
4792, FUNNY, ### if you're an upper middle-class english person you call unemployment a year off
12309, NOTFUNNY, ### not even close
5880, NOTFUNNY, ### it's this is what i have done because i'm excited by it because it's a wonderful thing and it's done something for me and of course it's accomplished a great deal

10813, NOTFUNNY, ### and i told myself there's not a chance you're getting out of the water
7556, NOTFUNNY, ### now to think about the potential for this think of all the places ink is supplied on business cards on the back of cereal boxes board games
2982, NOTFUNNY, ### create intimacy studies show that how we feel about our workplace very much depends on the relationships with our coworkers
12787, NOTFUNNY, ### we go to meetings in the present tense we go on family vacations in the present tense we go to the polls and vote in the present tense

6340, FUNNY, ### and since you don't know me as the woman walking around ted in her underwear that means i found a few things
5195, FUNNY, ### i look for it all the time
3468, NOTFUNNY, ### but it was deeper
10533, NOTFUNNY, ### and when we learn how to close the gene gaps then we can put a full string of together

8539, NOTFUNNY, ### ok you're welcome
10747, FUNNY, ### so we teach them over several days to find this space on these cues in the space and you can compare this for humans to finding your car in a parking lot after a busy day of shopping

14559, NOTFUNNY, ### and i started thinking maybe there's a pattern here
12312, NOTFUNNY, ### and that tool is very simply as chris suggested looking at us and the world from the plants' or the animals' point of view
11476, FUNNY, ### and we know that's a measurement error because it's messing up my data
823, FUNNY, ### in the third condition the experimenter got the sheet of paper and put it directly into a shredder

9120, NOTFUNNY, ### i can do that grossly with both of my hands or i can do it just with two fingers on each of my hands together
5019, NOTFUNNY, ### then one plus two is three two plus three is five three plus five is eight and so on

11575, FUNNY, ### it was interesting
15061, NOTFUNNY, ### you know i never really believed in legacy
2137, FUNNY, ### so we say area denial anti access asymmetrical strategies and their eyes glaze over

6863, FUNNY, ### and they get inside and they get it all on
3835, NOTFUNNY, ### if we add to that the many of us here now who are more productive because they have a pair of glasses then almost one in five indians will require eye care a staggering million people
12300, FUNNY, ### san diego bay is another example mobile bay or chesapeake bay but the reality is as sea level rises there's going to be lots and lots of new opportunities to consider
2004, FUNNY, ### first you get one stone then several more and more and more and more and more and then they well i will not do that

4309, FUNNY, ### even einstein hated this idea he called it spooky action at a distance
13021, NOTFUNNY, ### is a pursuit to highlight our true colors rather than the untrue white red black or yellow associated with race

13006, FUNNY, ### but you open one of the garage doors and there is a professional size boxing ring inside
14401, NOTFUNNY, ### it turns out that there are remarkable signs of progress out there often in the most unexpected places and they've convinced me that our great global challenges may not be so unsolvable after all
4055, FUNNY, ### and the reason it has a fountain in the courtyard is i wanted one and i had the checkbook so i bought one and put it there
3289, NOTFUNNY, ### it counts bombs and prisons as progress
10911, FUNNY, ### so of course we didn't take the kids the parents wouldn't allow that to happen
7039, FUNNY, ### and life starts to expand and expand and expand until it goes
1800, FUNNY, ### and it's a great story because what happened was he got off the plane at the toronto airport and he was welcomed by a non profit group which i'm sure someone in this room runs

13293, FUNNY, ### and since i'm a big list maker i actually listed them all
13425, NOTFUNNY, ### and because we are a proud profession it is very hard for us to look in the mirror and see our mistakes
3926, NOTFUNNY, ### and so human dignity whether it would be the dust up about the disabled reporter or what happened in that audiotape with billy bush and the way in which he spoke about women they put that aside and pretended as if they hadn't seen that or heard that because to them policies were more important
15146, NOTFUNNY, ### the guy who was supposed to build this machine was the guy in the middle vladimir from
13757, NOTFUNNY, ### i remember the night that i read about the series of coordinated bombings in the subway system in madrid and i got up and i walked over to the crib where my six baby girl lay sleeping sweetly and i heard the rhythm of her breath and i felt this sense of urgency coursing through my body
6049, FUNNY, ### i got here years ago and when i got here i was told various things like americans don't get irony

6488, FUNNY, ### no problem pm now billie that story i know but that's what scares the boomers i'm just telling you so i think it's good for us to share
2601, FUNNY, ### let's have a chat later
14103, NOTFUNNY, ### maybe these people are right
6789, FUNNY, ### so the entire data set is a billion times more awesome than this slide
14464, NOTFUNNY, ### so the servers are managed by a ragtag band of volunteers
10971, FUNNY, ### but even so a wonderful talent
12685, NOTFUNNY, ### and when we change our behavior in our daily lives we sometimes leave out the citizenship part and the democracy part
8514, NOTFUNNY, ### but they're very special
14725, FUNNY, ### i was with my brother and a mate having a few beers and i was watching the world go by had a few more beers and the conversation turned to fashion and how everything manages to come back into style
11616, FUNNY, ### they merged with aol and in just four years managed to shed about billion dollars of market capitalization showing that they'd actually mastered the art of applying moore's law of successive miniaturization to their balance sheet

2581, NOTFUNNY, ### it's insane right this is pandora
1241, NOTFUNNY, ### both of these zones should be part of our lives but being clear about when we want to be in each of them with what goal focus and expectations helps us better perform and better improve
2798, FUNNY, ### let me now turn to the last project which involves the national beverage of scotland
10126, NOTFUNNY, ### i was working as an internist and paul was finishing his training as a neurosurgeon when he started to lose weight

4458, FUNNY, ### i have to point out this has always been one of my favorite pictures of marie curie because i am convinced that that glow behind her is not a photographic effect
11609, NOTFUNNY, ### and i mean i stole arthur marshall's grandfather and made him my own
13690, FUNNY, ### i'm coming home

3052, FUNNY, ### come over and i'll do the whole lot of you
9938, FUNNY, ### i was and kids would say that were surprised that i didn't smell like curry
12877, FUNNY, ### i could see into the cockpit troy battling the controls and he just took one hand off reached back flipped a switch on the roof of the cockpit and it was the fasten seat belt sign you can see on the wall
10233, NOTFUNNY, ### he didn't follow his passion
11378, FUNNY, ### and there is the chief in all his regal finery with a laptop computer
7927, NOTFUNNY, ### so the answer is yes
11655, NOTFUNNY, ### two hundred years is not a lot of time while nature had three billion years to perfect some of the most amazing materials that we wish we had in our possession
3551, NOTFUNNY, ### so thank you very much
4794, FUNNY, ### i'm probably in the wrong country to talk about willingness to pay tax
5919, FUNNY, ### we've said well maybe older people report more positive emotions because they're impaired
7719, FUNNY, ### so this came out in a scientific journal a few years ago but more importantly it was featured on miami so you really know it's true
15024, FUNNY, ### and i hope jill that someday we will find evidence that there is intelligent life among humans on this planet
13688, NOTFUNNY, ### so that one is his
3396, NOTFUNNY, ### it didn't make them less happy it just didn't do much for them
4046, FUNNY, ### i want the happy ending implied by the title to my article which is incidentally the only part of the article that i didn't actually write
13411, FUNNY, ### y'all know what i'm talking about
770, FUNNY, ### and thankfully for all of us the english are very good at inventing things and then the gracious people that they are they let the world become very good at it
604, FUNNY, ### he wants to get your cookies
2766, FUNNY, ### so that's my talk
4377, NOTFUNNY, ### so what we found was when was low people were more likely to take revenge when they're treated unfairly
8110, NOTFUNNY, ### we looked at it and we said let's devolve to these people let's give these people a company where we take away all the boarding school aspects of this is when you arrive this is how you dress this is how you go to meetings this is what you say this is what you don't say and let's see what's left
12073, NOTFUNNY, ### ten minutes into the date the man stands up and says i'm not interested and walks out
8685, FUNNY, ### when you make the claim in fact that something on the internet is going to be good for democracy you often get this reaction
14160, FUNNY, ### this is with a method that we call in my lab graduate student with tweezers
13301, NOTFUNNY, ### and then we did one more of these
1933, NOTFUNNY, ### so the rains come they go down the rivers and the flooding happens
4797, FUNNY, ### you'd still have five million pounds in change and people would ask for the trains to be slowed down
14720, NOTFUNNY, ### they wouldn't have me
8846, NOTFUNNY, ### so we went out looking for solutions to ways that the world might end tomorrow and lo and behold we found them
3587, NOTFUNNY, ### the that were available were incredibly crude
9558, NOTFUNNY, ### this event killed their livelihood
4559, NOTFUNNY, ### his parents disowned him and accused him of bringing great shame to the royal family

2227, FUNNY, ### and they also offered him an internship
10133, FUNNY, ### went and formed an alliance with the sierra club and they formed a new organization called the green tea party
8756, FUNNY, ### you just can't rely on the people out there to help you with this
14011, FUNNY, ### and i guess somebody thought they needed to do that
12382, NOTFUNNY, ### you know that's not good enough
1155, NOTFUNNY, ### it turned out to be incredibly successful
14714, NOTFUNNY, ### but once you realize that people that this world was built by people no smarter than you then you can reach out and touch those walls and even put your hand through them and realize that you have the power to change it
8847, NOTFUNNY, ### there are really serious calamities staring us in the eye that we're in the same kind of denial about that we were about terrorism and what could've happened on september
11123, NOTFUNNY, ### we can think them out
3072, NOTFUNNY, ### so with that let me just show you a quick video to get you in the mood of what we're trying to explain
3363, NOTFUNNY, ### after years these two lovers still touch and kiss from their tomb
1150, FUNNY, ### it's the right idea but at the wrong time and the right idea at the wrong time is the wrong idea
12111, FUNNY, ### now in scientific terms we call this a very bad idea
9364, FUNNY, ### this picture is really fuzzy i apologize i had a bad cold when i took it
14303, FUNNY, ### funny they're very friendly to me before the opening tip but they really ignore me during the game
6761, NOTFUNNY, ### six years ago i started writing about women entrepreneurs during and after conflict
13365, FUNNY, ### so
13260, FUNNY, ### you know it's heartbreaking
950, NOTFUNNY, ### but i really appreciate being here
3934, FUNNY, ### and this election and all of the craziness that has followed has given us several opportunities to practice this skill
545, FUNNY, ### but the unfinished business for century science is to link together cosmos and micro world with a unified theory symbolized as it were at the top of that picture
12574, FUNNY, ### he's thinking of course it's all a concept of injecting typefaces into i don't know how to say it in english in order to make them become to almost have a song or a whole poem written with every ejaculation
12253, FUNNY, ### at this point i get a different kind of response
11420, FUNNY, ### that's him pressing my buttons back there which he does all the time
6816, NOTFUNNY, ### in the united states there is a state of the union address given by every president since
7820, FUNNY, ### and i called him up and said listen i ran one race and i won

6592, FUNNY, ### the gentleman to my left is the very famous perhaps overly famous frank gehry
7435, FUNNY, ### now i dress in a way that it sounds good
5506, NOTFUNNY, ### now being the youngest of eight i learned a few survival skills

4103, NOTFUNNY, ### it's the same in marketing
6228, NOTFUNNY, ### that chip and pin card that's in your pocket has a little chip on it that cost millions of pounds to develop is extremely secure you can put scanning electron microscopes on it you can try and grind it down blah blah blah

13387, FUNNY, ### im in entertain amaze mode
3287, NOTFUNNY, ### but in that first report kuznets himself delivered a warning

1458, NOTFUNNY, ### guilt inversely correlated with those things
11483, NOTFUNNY, ### the absence of disease is not health
3210, NOTFUNNY, ### we aren't a simple authoritarian regime anymore
10059, NOTFUNNY, ### but on that mountaintop waiting for the wind to come in just right i felt so many other things too exhilaration confidence
5355, NOTFUNNY, ### and blanc is kind of an unusual wine for bordeaux in having a significant percentage of the cabernet franc grape
9263, NOTFUNNY, ### you walk along and i'm about to pull this onto the floor
11770, FUNNY, ### here just for historical authenticity is a picture of me in that year
12662, NOTFUNNY, ### i'm struck as a teacher that we tell students to critically question every text they read every website they visit except dictionaries which we tend to treat as un authored as if they came from nowhere to give us answers about what words really mean
6493, NOTFUNNY, ### and now i have two daughters and it has made a difference in how i raise them
13485, FUNNY, ### in fact i'm leaving
8350, NOTFUNNY, ### but it was really through teaching
929, NOTFUNNY, ### teach a man to fish you feed him for a lifetime

11937, FUNNY, ### the chairs are on the tables and still drinking and he drinks a lot
11274, FUNNY, ### in a nutshell it's a choice between big brother watching you and you watching big brother
9589, FUNNY, ### so if you came here to talk about how french coffee will spread happiness in our brains that's a go
4818, NOTFUNNY, ### i felt very happy to be at the secondary school so i was determined to do anything possible to receive education
6971, NOTFUNNY, ### in fact winning isn't the word i won it once
14719, FUNNY, ### i love the little smile she does right over the top of the note like no problem everything's fine

12365, FUNNY, ### you know that it's a despotic building it wants us to feel like termites
11459, NOTFUNNY, ### right that's what i thought
4574, NOTFUNNY, ### look at africa's begging bowl
7893, NOTFUNNY, ### and after about the ten thousandth request for a maki roll we decided to give the people what they wanted
5094, NOTFUNNY, ### and high among them is education because education in a way very many people from their natural talents
735, FUNNY, ### just know where i came from why i did the
7439, NOTFUNNY, ### thank you
12364, FUNNY, ### a public place so dismal that the winos don't even want to go there
1790, NOTFUNNY, ### it means that you should just keep working on it
11816, NOTFUNNY, ### and i said i'm going to win the south by southwest award
15547, NOTFUNNY, ### now this gives a real meaning to the term blind faith which doesn't have the same negative connotation for me that it does for other people
15363, FUNNY, ### it all sort of started as a benign mistake like penicillin
14543, FUNNY, ### it's just that
2910, FUNNY, ### but then they'd remember that you're but a mere human of ordinary mortal intelligence that didn't finish university and they'd kind of forgive you and pet you like the dog
14214, NOTFUNNY, ### and in the last two decades astronomers have found thousands of
11861, FUNNY, ### maybe we could give it to our curator and see if he'd be brave enough to touch the cockroach

125, FUNNY, ### they could outsource all their problems protection from predators food finding
4291, NOTFUNNY, ### hopefully very soon we will be there because we are destined obsessed with making it real
6536, FUNNY, ### we're like the peace corps for nerds but instead of traveling to crazy interesting far off places you spend a lot of time indoors behind computers helping restore the fabric of our democracy
14638, NOTFUNNY, ### but even though most people would want to current technology makes the experience isolating
11551, NOTFUNNY, ### we didn't know for almost years until frank nelson cole came along

158, FUNNY, ### then a new tunnel
12802, FUNNY, ### the power of spectroscopy was actually realized by pink floyd already in

8898, FUNNY, ### the only reason these people buy touch tone phones is because you can't buy rotary phones anymore
11839, NOTFUNNY, ### bees get all of the protein they need in their diet from pollen and all of the carbohydrates they need from nectar

337, FUNNY, ### the surest way to become a millionaire is to start by being a billionaire and go into the movie business
14944, FUNNY, ### it's your job to solve
11644, FUNNY, ### and i've got here a little micrograms of white powder which i try not to let the security people see at airports
15022, NOTFUNNY, ### when melinda and i learned how little useful feedback most teachers get we were blown away

5316, FUNNY, ### the fact that you have rome without coffee makes rome with coffee look superior and not just to rome without coffee even superior to paris

9180, FUNNY, ### and unlike the juicy it does not threaten to attach itself to your brain rather it simply attaches itself to your brain
9167, FUNNY, ### and one of the things that we all discovered is you can get anywhere in los angeles at in the morning when there's no traffic
1337, FUNNY, ### but it's not like a flower can just get up and have sex with another flower although that would be awesome
12648, NOTFUNNY, ### and so i guess you'd say dissatisfied with the performance and quality of these medicines i went back to school in chemistry with the idea that perhaps by learning the trade of discovery chemistry and approaching it in the context of this brave new world of the open source the crowd source the collaborative network that we have access to within academia that we might more quickly bring powerful and targeted therapies to our patients
10399, NOTFUNNY, ### pretty much all the titles on them were by british or north american authors and there was almost nothing in translation
4857, FUNNY, ### i hope you also discovered a cure for it
12191, NOTFUNNY, ### metaphor is not just the detection of patterns it is the creation of patterns
3273, NOTFUNNY, ### keep on going
11049, NOTFUNNY, ### now my company deals with news ostensibly and as a result we were not in violation of this patent
6870, FUNNY, ### what it showed me is that there's a grassroots movement going on of socially responsible designers who really believe that this world has got a lot smaller and that we have the opportunity not the responsibility but the opportunity to really get involved in making change
9277, FUNNY, ### that's a day and i have them all
8360, NOTFUNNY, ### there are about species of ants
13660, NOTFUNNY, ### he started selling surplus parts kits to schools and stuff
2193, NOTFUNNY, ### and then we fast forward to about when three italian psychiatrists who were largely treating depression began to notice among their patients who were also that if they had an epileptic a series of epileptic fits a lot of them in a row the depression would very frequently lift
1182, FUNNY, ### the only accusation i ever heard leveled at him was when one of our clients said solly you are pathologically helpful
15582, FUNNY, ### i said yes i had but not for a really long time

1949, FUNNY, ### i'm going to go out on a limb here and say that if queensland police didn't have spray they wouldn't have shot people in those two years
12387, NOTFUNNY, ### we're going to have to re learn what the building blocks of these things are the street the block how to compose public space that's both large and small the courtyard the civic square and how to really make use of this property
13277, FUNNY, ### so where did this come from obviously from extraterrestrials
8928, NOTFUNNY, ### well these objections were perfectly reasonable a few years ago but things have changed
974, FUNNY, ### well then you could do an organ
5092, FUNNY, ### you know this is our policy
12116, NOTFUNNY, ### can we build systems that recognize objects identify emotions themselves play games and even read lips yes
7099, NOTFUNNY, ### my grandparents they were in the middle of it
15561, NOTFUNNY, ### but when i think about it this isn't the question that we should be struggling with
13455, FUNNY, ### but my particular favorite is that it turns out that on an online dating website how attractive you are does not dictate how popular you are and actually having people think that you're ugly can work to your advantage
4379, FUNNY, ### and he leaned forward over his podium and he said i needed you last night
12994, FUNNY, ### so i have to spend time with them so i manage the lunchroom every day

13541, FUNNY, ### go ahead
11341, NOTFUNNY, ### and i think that most alarming of all of it is seeing this rising animosity on both sides
12209, FUNNY, ### i'm here to tell you that the way our textbooks particularly mass adopted textbooks teach math reasoning and patient problem solving it's functionally equivalent to turning on two and a half men and calling it a day
5430, FUNNY, ### i've left out error correction and a bunch of other things
816, NOTFUNNY, ### the blind who attended the institute would play their games there just like i did at a field near my house
6239, FUNNY, ### so the senior citizens realized that they needed to have an emergency meeting

8452, NOTFUNNY, ### follow the calculus tag on and yes you will see people complaining about calculus but you'll also see people re those complaints making the argument that calculus is interesting and beautiful and here's a way in to thinking about the problem that you find unsolvable
3702, NOTFUNNY, ### and so as a child i saw jam disappear from the breakfast table then margarine disappeared then bread became too expensive then milk became rationed

9713, NOTFUNNY, ### she was my childhood friend
13903, NOTFUNNY, ### they said you can't study theory about brains
14165, FUNNY, ### or who say don't spend all your budget on a huge screen in the conference room and then place one tiny microphone in the middle of a table for people

10296, NOTFUNNY, ### and they didn't really have gold jewelry they had gold plated jewelry
730, FUNNY, ### but if you look at cultures which have cyclical and based on infinite lives you will see a comfort with fuzzy logic with opinion with thinking with everything is relative sort of mostly

11254, NOTFUNNY, ### and eventually our worst nightmare happened they flooded the engine
14150, NOTFUNNY, ### this is the first version of my computer voice

700, FUNNY, ### and they're laundered regularly by a very nice polish lady
13531, FUNNY, ### my fault
8344, FUNNY, ### and i said that's kind of too bad because we need million units a year
10935, FUNNY, ### and i explained to them that you know a lot of scientific research is done using that method
8940, FUNNY, ### and you might think well how can that be i mean a virus is you know it's stuff what's a made of yesterday was talking about viral telecommunications but what's a virus a virus is a string of nucleic acid with attitude
5593, NOTFUNNY, ### you've heard in the past several years the world is safer because saddam hussein is not in power
7431, NOTFUNNY, ### they were responding to immediate concerns
8508, FUNNY, ### i'm sure you all have friends that have used online dating

10482, NOTFUNNY, ### not solve it like you know in rigorous fashion but build a model an electro model using some coordinates of you know length all that sort of stuff from x ray photographs
14157, NOTFUNNY, ### this is the modern middle east where two millennia after the coming of christ virgin births are still a fact of life
1167, FUNNY, ### we're told what shape we're supposed to be in
7619, NOTFUNNY, ### and what this basically consists of is a large muscle that takes a good long time to contract and a latch that prevents anything from moving
777, NOTFUNNY, ### and we won this world cup in
12764, FUNNY, ### well i'm staying here because we wanted to demonstrate to you the power of this technology and so while i've been speaking you have been scanned
12419, FUNNY, ### if you use it during sex trying to be politically correct darling would you stroke my vagina you kill the act right there
5643, FUNNY, ### and after we failed i just kept failing
14420, FUNNY, ### he said that's leadership
1309, NOTFUNNY, ### so imagine we're in the middle of america
14171, NOTFUNNY, ### it's built with mostly off parts and costs about times cheaper than the james cameron used to explore the titanic
12224, NOTFUNNY, ### and the thing is is that oil is really an abstraction for us as the american consumer
11668, FUNNY, ### so war is an even less efficient way so i tend to prefer progressive taxation but of course history history will invent its own best ways and it will probably involve a combination of all of these
14684, FUNNY, ### in case you are wondering no i'm not wearing a dress and no i'm not saying what i'm wearing underneath
14658, FUNNY, ### party party yeah
15403, FUNNY, ### i wanted to there we go
242, FUNNY, ### no pressure
13611, NOTFUNNY, ### but before was a global symbol of liberation there were representative surveys already giving people a voice in quieter but still powerful ways
11272, NOTFUNNY, ### in the last years it's really changed the way that we live and work and the way that we see the world and what's great is we sort of think this is the next paradigm shift because now we can literally take the content that we share we discover and that we enjoy and make it a part of the world around us
14986, FUNNY, ### that also constitutes the entertainment portion of this talk so i hope you enjoyed it
1005, NOTFUNNY, ### but then we listen to the other percent of our stuff recorded
1173, FUNNY, ### so we have two halves of one of the best kitchens in the world
13068, FUNNY, ### but they're very small you know they're so close to the hospital we can never beat them out in these forests
2749, NOTFUNNY, ### so some of the people in some of the tents had dirty clothes and some of the people were in tents that were full of mosquitos that had been exposed to yellow fever
12893, FUNNY, ### they said what did you do you painted our house in exactly the same color as the police station
15311, FUNNY, ### we gathered up our materials and we went out of the room and counted to a half hour
5614, FUNNY, ### now not you not this talk but that is generally true
13819, FUNNY, ### that's a little harsh but still
8654, NOTFUNNY, ### and if you can do that then you can begin changing fundamental aspects of humanity
2663, NOTFUNNY, ### the second is you can put lots and lots of tests in a very small place
2936, NOTFUNNY, ### has started a dark net site
1250, FUNNY, ### juggling three balls is simple and normal

5817, FUNNY, ### we spent an afternoon together in the salt lake city public library memorizing phone books which was
10667, NOTFUNNY, ### in fact most people who get it don't even know they've had it
9040, FUNNY, ### and now you know why i'm fun at parties
4844, FUNNY, ### she enjoys making what she calls paper laptops
5061, NOTFUNNY, ### we meet at the pub
236, NOTFUNNY, ### and then inserts these long thin instruments and a camera and actually does the procedure inside the patient
5736, NOTFUNNY, ### my mom was a teacher my sister became a teacher and after college so many of my friends went into teaching
3868, FUNNY, ### i guess we could make a glow chicken
12394, FUNNY, ### that girl is me
15556, FUNNY, ### this is amazing
8591, NOTFUNNY, ### i can look at your medical records i can see if your pump is still pumping see if you're good to offer insurance to
12093, NOTFUNNY, ### there's no such thing as space men she said
4238, NOTFUNNY, ### they can go over complex terrain like grass no problem and not get destabilized
12515, NOTFUNNY, ### and what i loved about her work is when i would walk around it and look down into the sky looking down to watch the sky and it unfolded in a new way
7453, FUNNY, ### and only when you feel the pressure go back allow your hand to drift back to the tabletop but only when you feel the pressure
3063, NOTFUNNY, ### so some of the monks in the villages were doing the same thing themselves
11451, NOTFUNNY, ### and besides are highly specific urban habitats with their own insects plants and animals and even their own weather
2178, NOTFUNNY, ### a big stick a baton stick

2996, FUNNY, ### i'd taught the whole lesson wrong
12489, NOTFUNNY, ### you want to be transgressed
4505, NOTFUNNY, ### so the call went out
15000, NOTFUNNY, ### he's barefoot
11819, NOTFUNNY, ### one story is about this baby and his name is odin
6436, NOTFUNNY, ### anyway a goat's eyes are like a child's eyes
14262, FUNNY, ### now you're in your element
10726, NOTFUNNY, ### a country like america has four times the amount of food that it needs
9932, NOTFUNNY, ### maybe it's something special in his brain that allows him to make tools or to have mathematics
10720, FUNNY, ### i thought my goodness what taboo have i broken how have i insulted my host he pointed at three grains of rice at the bottom of my bowl and he said clean
13730, NOTFUNNY, ### so there's all kinds of bacteria on the earth that have no business being in you or on you at any time and if they are they make you incredibly sick
4718, NOTFUNNY, ### let me explain
2630, FUNNY, ### so why am i here talking to all of you well i guess i am a lifelong troublemaker and when my parents taught my twin brother and i to question authority i don't think they knew where it might lead
719, FUNNY, ### they've decided that liposuction fluid which in the united states we have a lot of liposuction fluid
1391, NOTFUNNY, ### in the new england journal of medicine there was a study published that showed that with appropriate people who had suffered without a heartbeat for three hours could be brought back to life without any neurologic problems

5824, NOTFUNNY, ### step over the threshold of your door into your foyer your hallway whatever's on the other side and appreciate the quality of the light
6703, NOTFUNNY, ### i walked as though my legs were wooden
5631, FUNNY, ### personification and the of intentional purpose is such a brilliantly successful way to model humans it's hardly surprising the same modeling software often seizes control when we're trying to think about entities for which it's not appropriate like basil with his car or like millions of deluded people with the universe as a whole
5808, NOTFUNNY, ### here's one of my favorite pictures of mars
14429, NOTFUNNY, ### and they didn't send him to some cushy hospital
6752, FUNNY, ### she's trying to get that done
214, FUNNY, ### equally it could be better than we've been led to believe but either way we have to start seeing it exactly as it is with all of its problems because it's only by seeing it with all of its problems that we'll be able to fix them and live in a world in which we can all be happily ever after
12585, FUNNY, ### as a white guy who spent his whole career at mit and harvard i've got no problem with this
5978, NOTFUNNY, ### baby i'll tell her remember your momma is a worrier and your poppa is a warrior and you are the girl with small hands and big eyes who never stops asking for more
8566, NOTFUNNY, ### but i wasn't happy
4342, FUNNY, ### i grew up at a time when actors from kuwait syria egypt used laughter to unite the region just as football can
13735, FUNNY, ### and the idea is that the congruence between seeing touch and feeling touch on an object that looks like hand and is roughly where a hand should be is enough evidence for the brain to make its best guess that the fake hand is in fact part of the body
14499, NOTFUNNY, ### those drivers could all fit in one red bus
7756, NOTFUNNY, ### that's what wanted to talk about
447, NOTFUNNY, ### so it's the first thing i do is i do my own
5949, NOTFUNNY, ### and i got some sort of satisfaction from learning that both and had had their computers infected dozens of times by completely unrelated other viruses over these years
14821, NOTFUNNY, ### yeah it's a wonderful achievement
962, FUNNY, ### we had one government agency and one company aircraft operator say you're crazy don't do that you're going kill the guy
3259, NOTFUNNY, ### i'm going to tell you about that technology
4015, FUNNY, ### it's kind of creepy
9450, NOTFUNNY, ### this is a jump i did in rio de janeiro
5083, FUNNY, ### so this whole event has been an elaborate build up to me doing another one for you so here it is
6460, FUNNY, ### i didn't get that sighted
9706, NOTFUNNY, ### we want to see what people can create so we conceived of a lab that could be shipped anywhere
15062, NOTFUNNY, ### now i'm in the business of creating art that will definitely even outlive me and i think about what i want to leave behind through those paintings
13728, FUNNY, ### this is the bacterial esperanto
9872, FUNNY, ### i'm only saying positive things from now on
13236, FUNNY, ### eight hundred two liter soda bottles oh yea
3392, FUNNY, ### i know what you're all thinking about are teams
954, NOTFUNNY, ### but that's what we're going to do
2948, FUNNY, ### and even animals like these donkeys love our buildings
10602, NOTFUNNY, ### i was paid in love
4816, NOTFUNNY, ### this is me with my dad when i was a little boy
2175, NOTFUNNY, ### you've got to track coalition partners
11, FUNNY, ### i don't know if i'll be able to make this any clearer
13575, NOTFUNNY, ### seven
8040, NOTFUNNY, ### the only real choice was who not when and not what you did after
15466, NOTFUNNY, ### now this is one model of how language comes to be namely it's legislated by an academy
5009, NOTFUNNY, ### and in these books you can find these short little glimpses of moments and experiences and people that i meet
6939, FUNNY, ### and i just want to make it absolutely clear that he's a really bad example of the optimism bias because he is in fact uniquely talented
3438, FUNNY, ### ok well maybe they're not worshipping me
5418, FUNNY, ### and now his shoulder says wino forever
15241, NOTFUNNY, ### it was a camel world like a camel with two the poor ones and the rich ones and there were fewer in between
3710, NOTFUNNY, ### and that proportion is primarily genetically determined
6356, FUNNY, ### here's an example of a project they made a motion activated confetti canon ball
7517, NOTFUNNY, ### number eight stay out of the weeds
13636, FUNNY, ### we dressed a cowboy as johnny cash and bolted the mannequin to the rocket
11581, FUNNY, ### we think they must be blinded by religion or by simple stupidity
8152, FUNNY, ### yeah
5950, NOTFUNNY, ### what we have here is a list of old viruses
14520, FUNNY, ### so when the storm is coming up it drives a pin into the ground
8051, NOTFUNNY, ### this is basically a penis camera on a motor
13468, NOTFUNNY, ### we estimate that just the electricity bill for running this data center is going to be in the tens of millions of dollars a year
8228, FUNNY, ### one of my favorite is that people named dennis are disproportionately likely to become dentists people named lawrence become lawyers because unconsciously we gravitate toward things that sound familiar which is why i named my daughter president of the united states brooks
3391, FUNNY, ### we went to a movie we left early and then went back to her room for
6683, NOTFUNNY, ### and you can go to any emergency room at any hospital and you would see lying on young black and latino men shot and dying
5863, NOTFUNNY, ### people like joe have a deficit in a brain area called the
510, NOTFUNNY, ### and before you know it you have a general sense of where everything is
670, NOTFUNNY, ### but it won't wipe out you know all life on earth so that's fine
10576, NOTFUNNY, ### so even though china's is a totally censored internet but still chinese internet society is really booming
13823, FUNNY, ### don't believe him
9941, FUNNY, ### so this here my student got accepted to law school with scholarships and not to brag but i did write one of his letters of recommendation

14323, FUNNY, ### and therefore what i say you have to fake it and make it
8798, NOTFUNNY, ### and there's an alternative
1866, FUNNY, ### so it sort of leaves us feeling like this

4906, NOTFUNNY, ### no my one sister virginia gave me a for the coach to dublin and that's how i ended up here
4414, FUNNY, ### so as you're thinking of that let's see what bit of advice we might want to give so that your next graduate doesn't become a tupperware salesman
3648, NOTFUNNY, ### talk us through this
7313, NOTFUNNY, ### here we asked them to get the robot's attention and indicate when they have the robot's attention

13177, NOTFUNNY, ### the very idea of a fat dance work by such a prestigious company was to put it mildly controversial because nothing like it had ever been done on mainstream dance stages before anywhere in the world

3814, NOTFUNNY, ### it comes from popular culture
10307, FUNNY, ### now this is the part of the talk where i tell you what's going to come as a result of all of this but i'm running out of time which is good because i don't know

11652, FUNNY, ### but here's the problem to catch cat fleas is difficult
6906, FUNNY, ### it's very ingenious as all freudian arguments are but didn't make much sense because i have seen the same delusion a patient having the same delusion about his pet poodle
9520, FUNNY, ### parents of baby girls go right from navel to knees and they leave this whole situation in here unnamed
4099, FUNNY, ### well you know the story
2421, NOTFUNNY, ### so eventually we have found ourselves in a totally marginalized position way over here
5395, FUNNY, ### my husband read it and he was like this is like eating your wheaties
9080, NOTFUNNY, ### nevertheless we spend the vast majority of our energy focused on this level of the pyramid trying to tackle things that are already completely adapted to human beings that are going to be very very difficult to address as we've seen in the case of

327, FUNNY, ### you know what the problem is with you you don't read other people's poetry and you don't got any subordination for verbal measures to tonal consideration
10304, FUNNY, ### right so when institutions are told they are obstacles and that there are other ways of coordinating the value they go through something a little bit like the kubler ross stages of reaction being told you have a fatal illness denial anger bargaining acceptance
6691, FUNNY, ### it changes the sound of your voice quite dramatically
7185, NOTFUNNY, ### the ancestor of the apes stayed in the trees our ancestors went out onto the plain
5307, FUNNY, ### now the interesting thing about this is when i take the lines away it's as if you haven't learned anything in the last minute
13140, FUNNY, ### i'm going to make a prediction
6191, NOTFUNNY, ### it's the most bizarre way to actually transport your food in any particular direction and at the same time it's got to deal with the heat
432, NOTFUNNY, ### which is why i'll show you a threat and an architectural response
1277, NOTFUNNY, ### and it has to settle
15058, FUNNY, ### and i've been very supportive until this picture shows up on my page
14057, NOTFUNNY, ### and our best avenue of escape from this actually is a kind of blind faith in our own cleverness and technology and efficiency and doing things more efficiently
14229, NOTFUNNY, ### literally think of proteins as that you can string together to execute a program
7174, FUNNY, ### every language communicates with pitch to varying degrees whether it's mandarin chinese where a shift in melodic inflection gives the same phonetic syllable an entirely different meaning to a language like english where a raised pitch at the end of a sentence

4497, NOTFUNNY, ### now when i was in my early i worked in the record business designing record covers for records and i had no idea what a great job i had
6548, NOTFUNNY, ### and it really helps me to understand how we see how we hear how we breathe how our brain can inform or mislead us
5599, NOTFUNNY, ### all right
11699, NOTFUNNY, ### but in the quarter century since then we've seen all of the fundamental supporting technologies go berserk
14167, NOTFUNNY, ### a room like this has acoustics this one very good acoustics
2473, FUNNY, ### we have a lot of connections with prisons apparently
2407, NOTFUNNY, ### but i was skilled at hiding it and from the outside appeared to be someone with everything to hope for and aspire to
13216, NOTFUNNY, ### i was a young driver out on the highway and the car in front of me i saw the brake lights go on
5619, NOTFUNNY, ### many people take refuge in headphones but they turn big public spaces like this shared into millions of tiny little personal sound bubbles
10135, NOTFUNNY, ### that right now is the open sewer for our industrial civilization as it's currently organized
13800, FUNNY, ### if i took a bite out of it you'd go wait a second
6243, FUNNY, ### so they were teaching me cuss word scrabble at night

9378, NOTFUNNY, ### that what we are living in is a century of idea diffusion
137, FUNNY, ### having said that i outlined my talk about five minutes ago
6089, NOTFUNNY, ### i've been always a proud woman of my achievements

2238, FUNNY, ### brave and open minded people sat down and felt comfortable saying yeah that shit makes sense
1200, FUNNY, ### we're not the only ones
5648, FUNNY, ### and the next night we had fish
2851, FUNNY, ### fact is there's a general rule if you don't like it it's fake if you do like it it's faux
5759, NOTFUNNY, ### we go from this view out to the stars
6359, NOTFUNNY, ### meanwhile the exact same year at bell labs the next revolution was about to be announced the next building block
10555, NOTFUNNY, ### i was for all the world the walking guy
2993, FUNNY, ### well i said to her you know kids don't learn from people they don't like
1235, NOTFUNNY, ### now can we do that no
3585, NOTFUNNY, ### and of course the swiss can be divided into two general categories those who make small exquisite expensive objects and those who handle the money of those who buy small exquisite expensive objects
3739, FUNNY, ### these are not glasses these are empty frames
10290, NOTFUNNY, ### it was below the minimum wage

15447, NOTFUNNY, ### no
6357, FUNNY, ### it's a lobster made of that's afraid of the dark
11866, FUNNY, ### he the wire we have no data
13684, NOTFUNNY, ### some observations on the slow development of this system as we learn how to do this difficult job
9884, FUNNY, ### the standards have changed such that as says the typical road to a subdivision in america allows you to see the curvature of the earth
3524, FUNNY, ### so i'm specifically interested in how we as humans relate to ourselves each other and the world around us
8596, FUNNY, ### we saw technology people being designers marketing people being architects and even finance people showing off their ability to write jokes
8024, FUNNY, ### my favorite is the middle one the player nose hair trimmer and torch
3891, FUNNY, ### we were three writers one from the one turkish and one indonesian like a joke you know
6649, FUNNY, ### i got accused in a few that i was actually sent by the pope to preach the trinity and catholicism in the middle east so you you believe who you want
1088, FUNNY, ### and there i am
7351, NOTFUNNY, ### and the first rule of the game is pretty simple
7957, NOTFUNNY, ### but we also have a straightforward political impact
10326, NOTFUNNY, ### so switch switch switch you're using glucose glucose glucose
3400, FUNNY, ### i was born and raised near manchester in england but i'm not going to say it in english to you because i'm trying to avoid any assumptions that might be made from my northern accent
11987, FUNNY, ### when a kid behaves like i did they don't exactly have to come out right no one is exactly shocked

7978, NOTFUNNY, ### design thinking is such a successful and versatile tool that it has been applied in almost every industry
1354, FUNNY, ### you've heard a lot of wrong things about it anyway
10183, NOTFUNNY, ### i call this the alpha piece
3131, FUNNY, ### i sell dreams and i peddle love to millions of people back home in india who assume that i'm the best lover in the world
874, NOTFUNNY, ### let me show you
39, NOTFUNNY, ### when we did the wall we did the palestinian side
5664, NOTFUNNY, ### and i'm always drawn to that
5496, NOTFUNNY, ### so i took my bee arena down to a small school in devon and the aim of this was to not just get the kids to see science differently but through the process of science to see themselves differently
15391, FUNNY, ### i found a link to jeffrey dahmer the serial killer but i will say that's on my wife's side
12318, FUNNY, ### i was born and raised in dakar senegal and through a combination of accidents and cosmic justice became a chef in the us
9825, NOTFUNNY, ### they don't experience this
11248, FUNNY, ### when i started talking to richard about what i was going to speak about i had recently come back from jordan where i had an amazing experience with a camel
1854, NOTFUNNY, ### they tell the history of our universe of our planet of life on this planet
6119, FUNNY, ### six centimeter of rainfall and they can telephone you that if you find any water problem in your city delhi bombay bangalore please come to our area of six centimeters we can give you water
11883, FUNNY, ### there's no reason for me to make this talk more depressing than it needs to be
11712, FUNNY, ### and here's the public service announcement for this project
7196, FUNNY, ### i'm not a fan
12020, FUNNY, ### so that's four points for insects
12142, FUNNY, ### we'll blow the air up we'll give it a landing target a tree trunk just outside the glass enclosure and see what it does
5008, NOTFUNNY, ### and recently i've been much more interested in collecting stories from reality so real stories
5814, FUNNY, ### now visualize a pack of overweight on bicycles
2318, NOTFUNNY, ### when i get those calls about performance that's one thing
10040, FUNNY, ### but if you go to alley yeah
8679, NOTFUNNY, ### she said please sing for me
11045, NOTFUNNY, ### it's a project by the long now foundation which was founded by including kevin kelly and stewart brand
8486, NOTFUNNY, ### that was a big deal that was important
14956, NOTFUNNY, ### but to give it to ourselves right now means a level of arrogance or cockiness that we're not comfortable with
706, FUNNY, ### you with me so i just need to hook you up
4715, FUNNY, ### but amongst you are probably those who have not only tried but they have successfully licked the elbow of the person sitting next to them
4304, NOTFUNNY, ### standing there that night i take a deep breath and look at and tell him i have never been more proud of you than i am in this moment
4611, NOTFUNNY, ### so nowadays everyone could produce his mono product
3788, FUNNY, ### so for those of you who are stressed by this picture i will add somebody for you
7460, FUNNY, ### ok and tell me when you're done
4889, FUNNY, ### yeah and i totally believe in causes yeah like all that stuff
5685, FUNNY, ### it's the mental equivalent of the full body massage
11875, NOTFUNNY, ### we poll a tiny fraction of the electorate and we predict the outcome of national elections
1655, NOTFUNNY, ### we harbor bias
1448, NOTFUNNY, ### i sat down and she said god you look like hell
6292, NOTFUNNY, ### it's a very popular museum now and i created a big monument for the government
15151, NOTFUNNY, ### maniac regained its memory when the power went off
11091, NOTFUNNY, ### i'm going to tell you about how i learned something about life
12957, NOTFUNNY, ### everybody there was doing what they were doing to take what they wanted the drug dealers the robbers the blood bank
7558, NOTFUNNY, ### don't let milk spoil your morning
1598, NOTFUNNY, ### i'd pump him for information i'm mentally scribbling notes for the stories i plan to write
1805, NOTFUNNY, ### we talked about the tv show we watched that evening
589, NOTFUNNY, ### part of the design is designing pieces that are letters long that have to overlap with all the other pieces to build smaller we have to design so they can go together
9354, NOTFUNNY, ### to discover new particles we need to reach these bigger numbers
4097, NOTFUNNY, ### and they're starting to dominate lots of professions doctors lawyers bankers accountants
5938, NOTFUNNY, ### and our hope is that by providing these tools that you'll be able to think of better ways to provide movement for the disabled to provide care for our aging population to help better educate our children to think about what the new types of middle class jobs could be for the future to both monitor and protect our environment and to explore the universe
12538, NOTFUNNY, ### it doesn't matter if you fail
4643, NOTFUNNY, ### you're what we call a partial paraplegic and you'll have all of the injuries that go along with that
9406, NOTFUNNY, ### it doesn't mean everyone goes in and eats dog food but businesspeople will use their own products to demonstrate that they feel that they're confident in them
715, NOTFUNNY, ### so keep doing it really hard
12182, FUNNY, ### or my favorite the love you mean it
7159, FUNNY, ### i think sex in insects is more interesting than sex in people
5043, FUNNY, ### now they didn't even care about that
15322, NOTFUNNY, ### it was a glorious experience
6575, FUNNY, ### and he said there was coming soon depending on the weather but he'd let me know when and so with about four days notice he said to go to this beach south of lisbon and a little after this guy will walk out of the water
11974, NOTFUNNY, ### i'm going to turn on the radio
12874, FUNNY, ### she asked me to call her back
12046, NOTFUNNY, ### a crisis of desire as in owning the wanting desire as an expression of our individuality of our free choice of our preferences of our identity desire that has become a central concept as part of modern love and individualistic societies
8384, NOTFUNNY, ### and others may say no never
11029, NOTFUNNY, ### this was the first time i'd encountered this idea that embracing a limitation could actually drive creativity
12850, FUNNY, ### and if they didn't take the flower i threw in a gesture of sadness and longing as they walked away
13430, FUNNY, ### and then i saw the obvious link because even we liberals love this country
5915, NOTFUNNY, ### because vivian knew what it was like to be far away from home
4626, FUNNY, ### well there wasn't much else to do in the spinal ward so we did
10082, FUNNY, ### what you see over here this yellow thing this is not a death ray
4751, FUNNY, ### okay well it's what i can do with some household
8862, FUNNY, ### but my friends it's so much worse than that
5875, NOTFUNNY, ### so someone's done that up
1708, FUNNY, ### unlike maggie
9850, FUNNY, ### but then i suffered a series of career catastrophes one after the other and finally found myself in television
7245, NOTFUNNY, ### and so had we had some information about our heart health to share with him maybe we would have gotten a better diagnosis the first time
10539, NOTFUNNY, ### or maybe not
5931, FUNNY, ### by the way check out my sweet ride
2618, NOTFUNNY, ### and i use that sort of technology to create things that are quite beautiful
333, FUNNY, ### but i found that there were some advantages to being in hollywood
11902, FUNNY, ### we think this can all be standardized and then people can personalize the stuff that goes into that wall and like the car we can integrate all kinds of sensing to be aware of human activity so if there's a baby or a puppy in the way you won't have a problem
12184, NOTFUNNY, ### there's a significant delta in fact between what we're willing to accept
5806, NOTFUNNY, ### so venus is too hot mars is too cold and earth is just right
6095, FUNNY, ### as he said to me that really pissed the french off
13248, NOTFUNNY, ### it is as if one by one the memories you used to harbor decided to retire to the southern hemisphere of the brain to a little fishing village where there are no phones
15572, NOTFUNNY, ### i don't know
2560, NOTFUNNY, ### which is why most people with this service get into the habit of saying hey i just got home
6040, NOTFUNNY, ### in contrast posed laughter we might think it sounds a bit fake
11791, NOTFUNNY, ### you're actually looking at the cross section of a memory right now
708, FUNNY, ### okay do it again a little bit
965, NOTFUNNY, ### we have something called the genome individuals we're sequencing as part of that
11012, NOTFUNNY, ### so soft power is something that really emerges partly because of governments but partly despite governments
11025, FUNNY, ### in the beginning of goodbye art i focused on forced destruction like this image of jimi hendrix made with over matches
7937, NOTFUNNY, ### now if you're like me and the other percent of the population who know that we are above average drivers you understand that's a very high bar
6929, NOTFUNNY, ### but when we were looking at the case sheets what we found was these people with the paralyzed phantom limbs the original arm was paralyzed because of the peripheral nerve injury
5538, NOTFUNNY, ### it's been seen nearly million times this year
11041, FUNNY, ### and i'm sure he did that later
1808, NOTFUNNY, ### i love the way that they see the world because they're seeing the world for the first time
9719, FUNNY, ### the crowd goes wild
424, NOTFUNNY, ### and we did video clips you can see them if you go to
2258, NOTFUNNY, ### and many women do not have knowledgeable clinical support
14656, FUNNY, ### basically i use my mouth in strange ways in exchange for cash
996, NOTFUNNY, ### americans think that this is reckless
11385, FUNNY, ### if all goes well next year i'll be back and i'll have a lot more to show you and if all doesn't go well i'll be in jail like wen ho lee
10449, FUNNY, ### people have used microscopes to look at the microbes that cover us i know you're not paying attention to me but
1904, NOTFUNNY, ### so i'm going to show you a few of the projects that i've been working on over the last couple years that reflect on our lives and our systems
10310, NOTFUNNY, ### some people get less dressed up
3288, NOTFUNNY, ### but we have ignored warning
8251, NOTFUNNY, ### my daughter is not even allowed to turn on the stove unless there's a grown up at home and she doesn't have to because she does not have to have the same kind of self reliance that i had to at her age
11239, NOTFUNNY, ### and i'm going to tell you when you trick the algorithm of your existence you will get some diversified experiences
10055, NOTFUNNY, ### and to give you an idea of the suffer fest that i was undergoing the first lap around the high school track took minutes
9906, FUNNY, ### then of course the next question is do you belong to any groups that wish to harm the united states i work at a university
14327, NOTFUNNY, ### the self you are self aware
5541, NOTFUNNY, ### i embody the central paradox
9235, FUNNY, ### but you get me
10275, FUNNY, ### it's amazing but the top level of the gang they actually call themselves the board of directors
6744, FUNNY, ### but i'm very civil in my action i assure you
5358, NOTFUNNY, ### and i wasn't that impressed
7451, FUNNY, ### a voodoo experiment
12537, NOTFUNNY, ### there are no contracts no written contracts
10644, FUNNY, ### he'd always walk up to his airplane in a kind of saunter devil saunter flick the cigarette away grab the girl waiting here give her a kiss
3340, FUNNY, ### in the planet would find it complex and confusing and my little dog watson would find it simple and understandable but would miss the point
7983, FUNNY, ### let me try to take this one step further
7172, FUNNY, ### you would call the police
4585, NOTFUNNY, ### the sun increases in its intensity in its brightness and finally at about billion years after it first started the earth is consumed by a large sun and this is what's left
14617, NOTFUNNY, ### and why because pancake girl and i we were both real with each other
509, NOTFUNNY, ### you need a lot of trust but it's not like i'm trying to get to pensacola please
944, FUNNY, ### to be new at ted it's like being the last high school virgin
11109, FUNNY, ### sounds like fast food doesn't it
7768, FUNNY, ### you know frankly i'm not that good but i do have one distinct capability i am remarkably fast at finding my bike
10894, NOTFUNNY, ### integrate climate solutions into all of your innovations whether you are from the technology or entertainment or design and architecture community
5071, FUNNY, ### see many of us will agree that lots of governments are unhealthy today
14068, NOTFUNNY, ### and i'm sure you all had your hands in mud or clay before
8109, NOTFUNNY, ### the opposite of work is idleness
52, FUNNY, ### well i had a lot of time to think during those eight hours and no sleep
9460, FUNNY, ### then past used to and the last one which is my favorite with the very romantic and dramatic notion to it once upon a time
1652, FUNNY, ### and i played weasel who was the sort of nerdy character on the show which made it a very major acting challenge for me as a old boy
12245, NOTFUNNY, ### you don't need to dig down for these chemicals and we can do things much more efficiently
11892, NOTFUNNY, ### right i mean there's just atoms in here and as long as we continue to build systems of atoms that display more and more intelligent behavior we will eventually unless we are interrupted we will eventually build general intelligence into our machines
7666, NOTFUNNY, ### now take my dear friend louis for example
5455, NOTFUNNY, ### i always tried to make the youngsters feel that they're there to get an education number one basketball was second because it was paying their way and they do need a little time for social activities but you let social activities take a little precedence over the other two and you're not going to have any very long
7974, FUNNY, ### and as you know everybody loves that too
7492, NOTFUNNY, ### excellent
4017, FUNNY, ### and of course surveillance is the first application that comes to mind
12081, NOTFUNNY, ### flocks that were a mile wide and miles long used to darken the sun
5663, NOTFUNNY, ### so i decided to cut off the head and the tail
9898, FUNNY, ### the question now is well who are we we're certainly a polluting wasteful aggressive species with a few nice things thrown in perhaps
12067, NOTFUNNY, ### it depends solely on whether you feel emotionally or socially disconnected from those around you
8630, NOTFUNNY, ### so if i'm trying to do homework and i don't feel like it i'll try to draw or you know waste my time
14630, FUNNY, ### six years ago my wife and i we packed our stuff we sold our little apartment in spain and for the same money we bought a house with a garden and little birds that come singing in the morning
7216, FUNNY, ### but that's because all the young people left
456, FUNNY, ### and at the same time i have to watch i don't inhale my own work at the same time
4073, NOTFUNNY, ### that's puff pastry day
958, FUNNY, ### so if you were in palm springs
2128, FUNNY, ### even in north korea i was an f student
3127, NOTFUNNY, ### i do research in a computer science lab that works on making computers see through images and video
2892, FUNNY, ### it will keep me for example from making an undignified departure from the stage
5081, FUNNY, ### and as chris says there is a hunger for videos of me
395, FUNNY, ### she chased that big seal away went and got its penguin and brought it to me
11659, FUNNY, ### it was another great location
14286, NOTFUNNY, ### so today computer viruses and trojans designed to do everything from stealing data to watching you in your to the theft of billions of dollars
11072, FUNNY, ### and then for a real beginner you would go down even further and elaborate more say open the oven wait for the light to go out open the door don't leave it open too long put the penguin in and shut the door
10795, NOTFUNNY, ### there is also a widely held belief that by blaming an attack on a nation state you are putting regulators at bay at least for a period of time
10816, FUNNY, ### because when i rendered his sentence australia and china are enjoying a relationship of unprecedented closeness in fact what i said was that australia and china were now experiencing fantastic orgasm
15125, NOTFUNNY, ### if we take many images of many slices of the brain and stack them up we get a three dimensional image
1481, FUNNY, ### which should tell you something about that relationship
11909, NOTFUNNY, ### can be concentrated there
11075, FUNNY, ### there is no reason for a child to read and write except blind faith and that it's going to help you
8889, FUNNY, ### if we don't find them then we can create them ourselves
1001, NOTFUNNY, ### and as i grew up it became worse and worse and i started to think of it as a form of control
9380, NOTFUNNY, ### two of the big success stories of the last years in retail one sells things that are super expensive in a blue box and one sells things that are as cheap as they can make them

423, NOTFUNNY, ### in lebanon it was not a book
284, FUNNY, ### maybe the banking career puts you on the cutting edge of new forms of financial manipulation
3818, NOTFUNNY, ### nigeria got its independence in
3037, FUNNY, ### apparently white men have a problem finding the clitoris
1077, NOTFUNNY, ### i figure about half of that are men so that takes the number down to
99, FUNNY, ### for in the months leading up to my selection like many young people i'd been active in the anti vietnam war movement and had written an article against lyndon johnson which unfortunately came out in the new republic two days after the dance in the white house
5930, FUNNY, ### from my home in california i shaved charlie in atlanta
1684, NOTFUNNY, ### if you look at all of the ancient literature ancient chinese icelandic greek indian and even the original hebrew bible they all mention very few colors
745, NOTFUNNY, ### and he wanted to hoist his flag to say i was here first
1297, NOTFUNNY, ### we normally have these very long lead in times
3770, FUNNY, ### we have made it quite clear to these people that an infinite monkey cage is roomy
11139, NOTFUNNY, ### but i think the point is that this is metaphor with teeth and it's with those teeth that i want to propose today that we rethink a little bit about the role of contemporary math not just financial math but math in general
7393, FUNNY, ### government contractors who had at one point worked for the remote operating unit and were describing in surprising detail on their what they had done in their former job
6115, FUNNY, ### that's why i said that this is a commercial break
281, NOTFUNNY, ### learning to control one of the most elemental forces in nature is a pivotal moment in any child's personal history

13818, FUNNY, ### okay
15434, FUNNY, ### as though she's a southern waitress
279, FUNNY, ### so if you're thinking about sending your kid to tinkering school they do come back bruised scraped and bloody
187, NOTFUNNY, ### even bacteria and some viruses have too
6316, NOTFUNNY, ### they didn't talk about vulnerability being comfortable nor did they really talk about it being excruciating as i had heard it earlier in the shame interviewing

9112, NOTFUNNY, ### the wood of your apartment continues outside becoming the facades
12464, FUNNY, ### i like animals look how much they like them
3623, FUNNY, ### yeah and that's the vehicle
9269, FUNNY, ### i'm sure that resonates with some of the
11460, NOTFUNNY, ### you get a rat and you put it in a cage and you give it two water bottles one is just water and the other is water laced with either heroin or cocaine
12641, FUNNY, ### and this was unfortunately successful
821, NOTFUNNY, ### we were growing as a team
13516, FUNNY, ### the other guys can talk about cheers
11661, FUNNY, ### they're almost there but not quite
14284, FUNNY, ### people normally write that down by the way
5594, NOTFUNNY, ### and it'll depend on where we live whether we live alone or have a family how much cool stuff we have how much we're willing to accept the risk of theft
4459, FUNNY, ### indeed there are many of us who aren't so sure about the manufacturer
13081, NOTFUNNY, ### there's a discrepancy in what's happening today in the emerging economies
5300, FUNNY, ### don't you in the front row worry or anything
2700, NOTFUNNY, ### i explained to chris that i was feeling a little bit stuck
7915, FUNNY, ### on one occasion i was doing it every time i did a point that they didn't like they actually threw stones at me and when i did a point they liked they starting shooting in the air equally not great
13975, NOTFUNNY, ### thank you
6822, FUNNY, ### understandably they weren't too happy with our line of questioning and let's just say we received our fair share of alternative facts
10628, NOTFUNNY, ### reaching success i was pretty good at coming up with good ideas
5890, NOTFUNNY, ### and in the past few years we've been able to propagate this lie even further via social media
3685, FUNNY, ### and they talked a lot about the weather how lovely it was that the sun had come out
9352, NOTFUNNY, ### then i would look at the stars and i would read about how well we understand gravity and i would think surely there must be some elegant way that these two systems match up
12017, FUNNY, ### so that's two points for insects
6219, FUNNY, ### and children i'm very proud of that picture that's my son playing in his band with his friends for the first ever gig i believe you call it where he got paid
20, NOTFUNNY, ### so the electromagnetic and weak forces are described by this pattern of particle charges in two dimensional space
7701, NOTFUNNY, ### this is the miracle of life
6509, FUNNY, ### so this is what i hope that you will do if i could be so bold and not have it deducted from my number of wishes
7895, NOTFUNNY, ### so replicating food taking it into that next level is where we're going
10480, NOTFUNNY, ### but wilkins you know thought was the best bet and he showed this x ray photograph

10670, FUNNY, ### i'll tell you when you can turn back
6514, NOTFUNNY, ### and that's actually what i'd like to talk about today
5744, NOTFUNNY, ### you know it's been proven that to hours a year with one attention a student can get one grade level higher
7951, FUNNY, ### growing up is about aiming to succeed wildly and being fulfilled by failing really well
13595, NOTFUNNY, ### she's a real inspiration
2289, FUNNY, ### you'll find that some of your fears are very well founded
15282, NOTFUNNY, ### this is a lovely book by a friend of mine named lee siegel who's a professor of religion actually at the university of hawaii and he's an expert magician and an expert on the street magic of india which is what this book is about net of magic
5226, FUNNY, ### they said yes but it's summertime
14004, NOTFUNNY, ### their wine glass at dinner is different from every other wine glass at the dinner party
6658, NOTFUNNY, ### consider this like the prophets all the superheroes are missing parents
48, NOTFUNNY, ### it was the first time the story of stonewall had been told to a national audience
11043, NOTFUNNY, ### and he begins to move beyond his self concern into the broader concern for others
13538, FUNNY, ### audience stop
5957, NOTFUNNY, ### so a single idea from the human mind it could start a groundswell it could be a flash point for a movement and it can actually rewrite our future
9127, NOTFUNNY, ### i disagree with this
9313, NOTFUNNY, ### and in the process i learned something very important
11083, NOTFUNNY, ### one is that this book knows about itself
6244, NOTFUNNY, ### i was running across the street and the only thing that i actually remember is feeling like a grenade went off in my head
2585, NOTFUNNY, ### really
5510, NOTFUNNY, ### then human beings stepped out of the darwinian flow of evolutionary history and created the second great wave of evolution which was we changed the environment in which we evolved
12285, FUNNY, ### my mother thought that this was not very proper so she sat with us to add propriety to this activity
12970, NOTFUNNY, ### this again is life expectancy
1214, FUNNY, ### they don't have any shoes yet
3663, FUNNY, ### i mean if i was stranded on an island and the only way to get off that island was the make a pretty i'd die there
12849, FUNNY, ### i was a self employed living statue called the eight foot bride and i love telling people i did this for a job because everybody always wants to know who are these freaks in real life
2437, FUNNY, ### so i mean we wanted it to work
9184, FUNNY, ### and to tell you the truth i never really bought into this argument in part because i never saw three american presidents agree on anything else in the past
4531, NOTFUNNY, ### but look at number three creativity number two critical thinking number one complex problem solving all the things a robot or a computer is really bad at
1239, FUNNY, ### when i needed a knee surgery i didn't tell the surgeon poke around in there and focus on what you don't know
9283, NOTFUNNY, ### this is the so called lansdowne portrait
8750, FUNNY, ### you know hans the mick jagger of ted
9493, FUNNY, ### who are on par with strangers
5773, NOTFUNNY, ### this is in the national theatre studio the place where they cook new ideas
14147, NOTFUNNY, ### when i find myself in a conversational situation i need to type fast and to jump right in
8626, FUNNY, ### i'm also the first time here and
8880, FUNNY, ### we're almost done
4850, FUNNY, ### anyway last year i heard about the himalayas and the melting of the and the melting of the glaciers because of climate change
6143, NOTFUNNY, ### it increases their economic value
3765, NOTFUNNY, ### they might some place out there
10042, FUNNY, ### he said that one of the reasons he invented bebop was that he was pretty sure that white musicians wouldn't be able to replicate the sound
11754, FUNNY, ### and so you know percent approval rating ain't so bad
13040, FUNNY, ### rather than the whole coat of arms on a solid background and writing amsterdam below it they just take the key elements of the the shield and they turn it into the most city flag in the world
3649, NOTFUNNY, ### so it's important to appreciate that is only relevant if it is rapid and complete
10732, FUNNY, ### so that's probably a bit of a counter intuitive idea so i'll say it again let it sink in if we want to solve problems like hunger poverty climate change global conflict obesity i believe that we need to aspire to play games online for at least billion hours a week by the end of the next decade
8506, FUNNY, ### anybody ever written on my way then you've also lied
5352, NOTFUNNY, ### pei
5044, FUNNY, ### what they wanted was my email address so they could ask me more questions

5688, NOTFUNNY, ### it was at the same ted two years ago when richard and i reached an agreement on the future of ted
12933, NOTFUNNY, ### and that's the end of the quote from douglas
11399, NOTFUNNY, ### the sort of artist conceptions
3568, NOTFUNNY, ### and let me recap some of the stuff you've seen
2628, FUNNY, ### this brutal pragmatism that she had i mean i was four and she told me mommy is santa
3164, FUNNY, ### i actually got a natural high and a good mood for the entire day since i remember seeing all of this matrix text in class and here i'm all like know kung fu
12134, NOTFUNNY, ### last year saw billion dollars in corporate fraud alone in the united states
463, NOTFUNNY, ### and then she just said you're going back to school tomorrow
14106, FUNNY, ### and farmers could protect their crops that they want to sell to whole foods because our photons are percent organic
6353, NOTFUNNY, ### they had different kinds of mustards and vinegars and over different kinds of fruits and vegetables and more than two dozen different kinds of bottled water and this was during a time when we actually used to drink tap water
11152, NOTFUNNY, ### that person ate the marshmallow
9533, NOTFUNNY, ### and that's absolutely correct
13197, FUNNY, ### this is kind of like something i used to do in third grade
4775, FUNNY, ### a copper jelly mold
14599, NOTFUNNY, ### livestock is also one of the biggest culprits in land degradation air and water pollution water shortages and loss of biodiversity
532, NOTFUNNY, ### but if you think about it if you have a lily pad and it just divided every single day two four eight sixteen in days you'd have
2759, NOTFUNNY, ### pouring rain couldn't see a thing
14885, FUNNY, ### that was fortunate for me because in most press photos i appear too although often between legs
12298, FUNNY, ### hello santa claus
6833, NOTFUNNY, ### these whistle blowers risk their careers their friendships to bring out the truth about their companies
14325, NOTFUNNY, ### it can't afford to doubt the person who tends the child
14146, NOTFUNNY, ### human speech is an ingenious manipulation of our breath within the sound chamber of our mouth and respiratory system
5090, FUNNY, ### i came across a great quote recently from abraham lincoln who i thought you'd be pleased to have quoted at this point
12934, NOTFUNNY, ### he stood by it in the face of repeated calls for clarification or withdrawal
2959, FUNNY, ### i just say that to encourage transparency so you can be seated
5305, FUNNY, ### and the title for my cookbook was going to be dining without crumbs the art of eating over the sink
15402, FUNNY, ### he got exactly the same response lots and lots of
7710, FUNNY, ### harvard was wrong big time

5416, FUNNY, ### it was supposed to break but that's okay
536, FUNNY, ### by the way they are always hungry
13011, FUNNY, ### what i'm saying is our kids need us to be a little less obsessed with grades and scores and a whole lot more interested in childhood providing a foundation for their success built on things like love and chores
11763, NOTFUNNY, ### and that's led to this discussion that's completely raw completely unfiltered
5659, FUNNY, ### we showed this to the hotel people the other day and they were terrified and said that nobody would come to the ritz carlton anymore because of this fish
14257, NOTFUNNY, ### pollution energy shortage environmental diversity poverty
3790, NOTFUNNY, ### but here we are on a planet and there are so many things that are amazing about earth that we're searching far and wide to find things that are like that
9541, FUNNY, ### we need more of the courage of drag queens and astronauts
468, NOTFUNNY, ### and the static is interfering with everything
1647, FUNNY, ### and so that could be that could be potentially a good alternative to solar powered refrigerated camels
11548, NOTFUNNY, ### and today i want to show you one of those musical notes a number so beautiful so massive i think it will blow your mind
3606, FUNNY, ### so gary is capable of currently he's capable of going times faster than a tunnel boring machine
8209, FUNNY, ### i've got that stuff up on if you want to look at it
6477, FUNNY, ### and that's the reason i beat him actually because i respected him
704, NOTFUNNY, ### i was brought up in the near wembley with asian english caribbean irish families living in our street and the neo nazi national front was massive then with regular marches and attacks on us and a permanent threat and often a frequent reality of violence against us on the streets in our homes typically by neo nazis and other racists

14756, NOTFUNNY, ### very few animals i think elephants and apes can do that kind of thing
3589, FUNNY, ### it's not a good idea but it's just important
9535, FUNNY, ### we'll let those roam around the auditorium a little bit
11779, NOTFUNNY, ### obviously at this stage of life he was in a somewhat more dignified form than he was back then
4361, FUNNY, ### she told this to one of her colleagues who said well what does your boyfriend do sarah thought quite hard about the things i'd explained and she concentrated in those days on listening
14105, FUNNY, ### now in our company this is what we call the pinky suck moment
5168, FUNNY, ### and we ate an awful lot of the sweet potatoes
9428, FUNNY, ### and the odds are seven to one against your finding the prince
4846, FUNNY, ### no what i'm suggesting is that we should leap off we should increase our velocity so it's high and we should leap off one side and go the other of course having calculated our differential equation very carefully
1868, FUNNY, ### and as i said before you never know who you might inspire
9485, NOTFUNNY, ### that could be as simple as making an introduction between two people who could benefit from knowing each other
11823, NOTFUNNY, ### but to see something like the computer is amazing because software is simple
14324, FUNNY, ### this is the mantra of the united states of america
5793, NOTFUNNY, ### now it could happen but i'm not going to plan my life around it
6571, FUNNY, ### it was unequivocally not something a squirrel could chew on
8399, NOTFUNNY, ### i look around and see if there's a bin that i can turn upside down
5325, NOTFUNNY, ### but again it's the same story that if we take the background away the illusion comes back
9438, FUNNY, ### what happens in vegas ends up on
6557, FUNNY, ### our good friend chris has about a six percent but with a bullet i might add
7861, FUNNY, ### so essentially we had our first carbon neutral volcano
6402, NOTFUNNY, ### i don't believe in straightforward narratives
10091, NOTFUNNY, ### we had so many motors aligning the joints and those kinds of things
11252, NOTFUNNY, ### but over the years the blackboards were fine but they ran out of chalk
4461, NOTFUNNY, ### so i thought well maybe i should teach a course on ignorance something i can finally excel at perhaps for example
3214, NOTFUNNY, ### let me show you something i haven't shown anywhere actually
9069, NOTFUNNY, ### and this went on for some time until i caught myself scanning a newspaper article with tips for fast people
8886, FUNNY, ### when people have this technology in their hands you have a do biotech kit grow your own grow your dog grow your own cat
4262, NOTFUNNY, ### now here's the bad news
10193, NOTFUNNY, ### let me tell you a story
8884, FUNNY, ### i wanted to just talk for one minute about the future of biotechnology because i think i know very little about that i'm not a biologist so everything i know about it can be said in one minute
6984, FUNNY, ### and in a lot of states you're actually better off if you took the images of yourself because then you can file a copyright claim
1395, NOTFUNNY, ### the northern great barrier reef lost two thirds of its corals last year over a distance of hundreds of miles then bleached again this year and the bleaching stretched further south
15442, FUNNY, ### your child does not think you're that interesting
9329, FUNNY, ### i love the fact that he seems to be going off to war having just finished the washing up
1635, NOTFUNNY, ### we talked
10261, NOTFUNNY, ### when you have two in one organism it's not a coincidence
7657, FUNNY, ### i could tell from his tone the same tone that you would use to say something like you're a supporter of terrorism
12110, FUNNY, ### and so i started reading calculus books for fun
13142, NOTFUNNY, ### it is absolutely possible
9820, NOTFUNNY, ### you can see the orientation
9656, FUNNY, ### and in fact and maybe you've heard this speaking going through a breakup is a lot like going through cocaine withdrawal which i find reassuring
4688, NOTFUNNY, ### i mean there's the story about your mother allegedly dumping you in a field aged four and saying ok walk home
8637, FUNNY, ### children one two three go
12798, FUNNY, ### so what that means is that people will be able to people will be able to call in from their mobile phones and do this test and people with parkinson's could call in record their voice and then their doctor can check up on their progress see where they're doing in this course of the disease

7045, FUNNY, ### and this might have just one or two small ethical political moral implications
13106, FUNNY, ### i know that in he no longer ruled the soviet union but that's the best picture that i can find
15089, FUNNY, ### they are dangerous to give birth to are agonizing to give birth to
5437, FUNNY, ### that image reminded me of something
13981, FUNNY, ### so this is something that we're now going to try for the first time live and this is really truly very frightening
11986, FUNNY, ### where i come from if you weren't a drag queen or a radical thinker or a performance artist of some kind you were the weirdo
15178, FUNNY, ### i promise you i'm a lot more romantic than that
14814, FUNNY, ### you get some sense of the size you can just see these standard size people underneath
5509, FUNNY, ### so you may have thought that the creation of life was going to happen in something that looked like that
13625, NOTFUNNY, ### it is good for the kind of lives we want to live because young men especially have changed enormously and they want to have lives that are animated by terrific relationships with their children
7084, FUNNY, ### now my publishing career began when i designed the cover for my eighth grade yearbook and if you're wondering about the style of dress i put our mascot in i was really into bell devoe and mc hammer and vanilla ice at the time
6032, NOTFUNNY, ### so here we've got some laughter for you
12477, NOTFUNNY, ### generally about percent of the people liked it
5787, FUNNY, ### we work in groups in big cities and in small villages
13940, NOTFUNNY, ### they choose to leave their homes in order to earn money to learn new skills and to see the world

7162, NOTFUNNY, ### insects seem like they do everything that people do
14749, NOTFUNNY, ### and it's really unfair to humanity because humanity is actually much more cooperative and than given credit for
15020, FUNNY, ### it doesn't matter whether you're a basketball player a tennis player a gymnast or a bridge player
12912, NOTFUNNY, ### meditate for half an hour
13139, FUNNY, ### and so what do you do you go on vacation
4059, FUNNY, ### i've actually eaten seven of those baskets and they're very good
5070, FUNNY, ### that patient was my government
2794, NOTFUNNY, ### it's easier to help who perceive that there's something foreign inside of them that needs to be but it's difficult with because we believe we are seeing the truth
8866, NOTFUNNY, ### if you're an average sort of person percent of your life will be spent asleep which means that if you live to then years will have been spent entirely asleep
7307, NOTFUNNY, ### the worst thing that's happened in the cave so far was one of the robots fell down ten meters
6510, FUNNY, ### you see if this is true and i believe it is that the digital world you all created has the creative imagination from the physical constraints of matter this should be a piece of piss
9236, FUNNY, ### good evening and welcome to spot the ted presenter who used to be a broadway accompanist
13914, FUNNY, ### those of us who used to be very depressed for a long time we started to feel less depressed whereas the newcomers they were so not used to feeling this way that they were now even more depressed
10613, FUNNY, ### and i call this my year of speaking dangerously
6169, NOTFUNNY, ### with ideas false ideas about human beings will not go away if people believe that they're true
5677, NOTFUNNY, ### and so we finally ended up making it
7882, NOTFUNNY, ### now in the course of time we've come to realize that different parts of the brain do different things
755, NOTFUNNY, ### so i will tell you right off of the bat
15422, FUNNY, ### and no problem but unfortunately continuing with the scientific examination of this painting came out that rafael did not paint the unicorn did not paint the puppy dog actually left the painting unfinished so all this writing about the exotic symbol of the unicorn unfortunately is not very reliable
3318, FUNNY, ### so the spelling spider is a cousin of the spelling bee
7791, FUNNY, ### i'm not talking about a revolution where you have to worry about the governor of california showing up at your door a la the terminator
11771, FUNNY, ### i mean she knows i'm not a dog
10093, NOTFUNNY, ### and just by the tactile information it successfully crosses over these types of terrains

11559, FUNNY, ### it's about concrete
1134, NOTFUNNY, ### and what we're learning is going to shed some light on what the romantic writers and poets described as the celestial openness of the child's mind
12966, NOTFUNNY, ### so recently we have realized that the ordinary matter in the universe and by ordinary matter i mean you me the planets the stars the galaxies the ordinary matter makes up only a few percent of the content of the universe
5063, NOTFUNNY, ### entrepreneurs never come and they never tell you in a public meeting what they want to do with their own money what opportunity they have identified
11193, FUNNY, ### one to save your life one to save the life of some lucky bystander
15242, NOTFUNNY, ### fortunately i will be able to comfort you by showing why it was not your fault actually
6944, NOTFUNNY, ### but private optimism about our own personal future remains persistent
492, FUNNY, ### and even some internet engineers today say the whole thing is a pilot project and the jury is still out
13872, NOTFUNNY, ### now the human part related to animals look at the left side of that
11510, FUNNY, ### i say it doesn't matter if you're a washer or a wiper a sitter or a squatter the human user interface should be clean and easy to use because after all taking a dump should be pleasurable

14751, NOTFUNNY, ### otherwise they wouldn't be pulling so hard
2470, FUNNY, ### yes
1871, NOTFUNNY, ### so i'm going to share it with you now but you have to promise me you're going to share it in turn
12472, FUNNY, ### this is what lemmings believe
941, NOTFUNNY, ### that's what happens to buildings
14225, FUNNY, ### we're going to reprogram the bacteria in your gut and we're going to make your poo smell like peppermint
6148, FUNNY, ### these optimistic young bastards promise to honor and cherish each other through hot flashes and midlife crises and a cumulative weight gain until that far off day when one of them is finally able to rest in peace
13862, FUNNY, ### two hours of chemistry class in a language that you don't yet fully understand can be a pretty good sedative
11904, NOTFUNNY, ### learning took place in schools
9289, FUNNY, ### one taiwanese production studio would interpret american politics in
13050, NOTFUNNY, ### there's a gigantic gear representing industry there's a ship recognizing the port a giant stalk of wheat paying homage to the brewing industry
11625, NOTFUNNY, ### now we can use the tools of the century to try and observe what is rather than ask what should be believed
12341, NOTFUNNY, ### and he was a clever man
10798, FUNNY, ### the answer is the first poem was generated by an algorithm called that was created back in the and the second poem was written by a guy called frank o'hara who happens to be one of my favorite human poets
1928, FUNNY, ### they're fully functional field tested ready to roll out
10691, FUNNY, ### i distinctly remember telling my dad that i wanted to buy a navy blue secondhand peugeot on and he rightfully pointed out that the seller's name was invisible wizard and that this probably was not such a good idea
11726, FUNNY, ### it worked out
14865, FUNNY, ### look there united states
13813, NOTFUNNY, ### we like to hang together in groups just like just like lions
3401, FUNNY, ### the only problem with masking it with chinese mandarin is i can only speak this paragraph which i have learned by heart when i was visiting in china
517, NOTFUNNY, ### they eventually decided not unanimously by any means not to include his real name despite the fact that nearly all media reports did
4823, FUNNY, ### there's also a weather goddess who controls a random stock market and random weather
13922, NOTFUNNY, ### but there was hope
15027, FUNNY, ### i have shown that swedish top students know statistically significantly less about the world than the chimpanzees
5386, FUNNY, ### very impressive
14754, NOTFUNNY, ### so it's actually fairly simple for them
773, FUNNY, ### of course a lot of people said maybe they dance better than they play
12103, NOTFUNNY, ### another reason jane is not so happy is because she's worried
14090, FUNNY, ### this is that piece installed in a gallery in new york those are my parents looking at the piece
11073, FUNNY, ### i suspect that some of you might not even understand that language
12006, FUNNY, ### i'm well red
7223, NOTFUNNY, ### what i discovered in these interiors is that there was a disconnect between the exterior shell and the interior architecture of the pieces
94, NOTFUNNY, ### if you look across industries and ask people about their biggest idea their most important suggestion percent of them stayed silent instead of speaking up
3381, FUNNY, ### recognition seemed to come to those who prioritized novel and sculptural forms like ribbons or
9567, FUNNY, ### so we need to reconfigure we need to reunite the economic and the political spheres but we'd better do it by democratizing the reunified sphere lest we end up with a surveillance mad that makes the matrix the movie look like a documentary
10684, FUNNY, ### on average it was just a completely pointless exchange of money that i would regret
1496, NOTFUNNY, ### they think well you know figuring out what people think about cola's not that easy
7856, FUNNY, ### this is mountains out of a timeline of global media panic
15179, FUNNY, ### took me to visit prince and he's a chubby little guy
10927, FUNNY, ### in other words they were all speaking like james tooley
6007, FUNNY, ### now that i've oversold it here's a picture of the armor that i made
842, NOTFUNNY, ### now we had another version of this experiment
10982, NOTFUNNY, ### thank you so very much for having me here today
4607, NOTFUNNY, ### more specifically i want you to feel like you're capable of becoming an excellent long distance swimmer a world class language learner and a tango champion
6595, FUNNY, ### it was intuitive
14178, NOTFUNNY, ### it's brought a lot of bad stuff like the stuff that i just described but it's also brought a lot of good stuff
3132, FUNNY, ### if you don't tell anyone i'm going to tell you i'm not but i never let that assumption go away
14615, FUNNY, ### do not give them that sense of false hope
13039, FUNNY, ### you know yeah
8953, FUNNY, ### well that got us a little angry so we changed it to fightin' splashy
3979, FUNNY, ### this has to be a bridge to the point where you can get to wind to the point where you can get to solar to the point where you can get to nuclear and hopefully you won't build the next nuclear plant on a beautiful seashore next to an earthquake fault
8747, NOTFUNNY, ### that's exactly what i needed today and then exited without revealing what had happened and went in all different directions
6743, FUNNY, ### i remember the time when my mother used to dress me up as a little girl that's me there because she wanted a girl and she has only boys
5172, FUNNY, ### northeast airlines was the only company i heard of that was selling for less than five dollars a share
7930, FUNNY, ### now before we get started this is great
9769, FUNNY, ### in fact when i reported this figure in the one of our readers joked and said this figure is only shocking to percent of the population
11205, NOTFUNNY, ### i thought it was quite an interesting experiment in the principles of rocket science
3777, NOTFUNNY, ### well there is one proviso
8226, FUNNY, ### and they've become elegant and slender they don't really have thighs they just have one elegant on top of another
14289, NOTFUNNY, ### the percentage of working families without health care up by four percent
10231, NOTFUNNY, ### people with dirty jobs are happier than you think
4040, NOTFUNNY, ### last year at this time there were vessels mariners held hostage
12340, FUNNY, ### and by the way when i graduated from mit i thought the worst and silliest thing to do would be to go to paris for six years
4831, NOTFUNNY, ### chris could you stand up and let them see you a young visionary filmmaker who's made a film
3694, NOTFUNNY, ### there weren't many of them available and they weren't quite as easy to find as the foreign books
3465, FUNNY, ### and i'm out there kind of tripping out on my little
5504, FUNNY, ### to give you a sense of what that's like when my family went on vacation we had a bus
13235, NOTFUNNY, ### there was a center there where they were teaching people how to read and write and get vaccinations against the many diseases you can get from sorting through garbage
3065, NOTFUNNY, ### if you're pregnant take care of your pregnancy
10772, FUNNY, ### and that's despite the fact that a supernova is so bright so brilliant an event that it would kill you stone dead at a range of several light years
7956, NOTFUNNY, ### but for me so is immigration
3042, NOTFUNNY, ### stay away from it
11225, FUNNY, ### and this magical superhighway also took the demons of our nature and gave them ferraris
6751, NOTFUNNY, ### that's when i realized you know cartoons are really powerful art comes with responsibility
15467, NOTFUNNY, ### let me start off with a technical problem in language that i've worried about for quite some time and indulge me in my passion for verbs and how they're used
11090, FUNNY, ### and then you might get something
7119, NOTFUNNY, ### he can't talk at all
6732, NOTFUNNY, ### and now he's in edinburgh
8848, NOTFUNNY, ### we are all much healthier than we were years ago
10479, NOTFUNNY, ### and oh that's the book little book
5750, FUNNY, ### so at least you'll admit that if fruit flies are not as clever as mice they're at least as clever as pigeons
11060, NOTFUNNY, ### let's start by thinking about the member countries of the or the organization of economic cooperation and development
10314, FUNNY, ### if you're thinking it's ironic that i asked people to download another app so that they would spend less time on their phones yeah but you gotta meet people where they are
9292, FUNNY, ### and last is that we're more connected now to more people on the planet than ever before except for if you're sitting next to someone
10774, FUNNY, ### it would be a bit like experiencing a supernova explosion but at point blank range and for millions of years at a time
10351, NOTFUNNY, ### i decided let me keep taking these art history classes
9089, NOTFUNNY, ### in today's context it was a bunch of crap but it was the law of geology vertical tectonics
8618, FUNNY, ### it probably reminds you of our own social communities and our families well at least some families
10507, NOTFUNNY, ### the most impressive airplane ever i believe was designed only a dozen years after the first operational jet
469, NOTFUNNY, ### and i looked at it underneath the microscope
2449, NOTFUNNY, ### as a child i thought she was born with them with beautiful black lines and detailed symbols
3276, FUNNY, ### and before we know it right we're anxious about feeling anxious
5324, NOTFUNNY, ### the bottom one yellow
6190, NOTFUNNY, ### they are grown completely in a ball of dung
9245, FUNNY, ### i mean microsoft word was last just a word processor in you know the eisenhower administration
11468, NOTFUNNY, ### i think it's really important to understand that something like this is totally open
12562, NOTFUNNY, ### what's next what's next is going to be people
11096, FUNNY, ### now i still have my struggles particularly with the anxiety but i'm able to manage it through daily mediation yoga and a relatively healthy diet
3158, NOTFUNNY, ### i'll have him cut out letters out of construction paper for the board
14688, FUNNY, ### here's a fun fact you're looking at the world's biggest pocket
8662, NOTFUNNY, ### another thing it's good for is navigation
15564, NOTFUNNY, ### we've never seen any evidence of even a single instance of specific harm and because of that i'm comfortable with the decisions that i made
11100, FUNNY, ### i haven't come to the best part
2935, NOTFUNNY, ### another called twister and so on and so on
8745, FUNNY, ### and we'll act as if it's just an unfortunate mistake we've made forgetting our pants on this cold january day
6165, FUNNY, ### when we say of somebody that he's in it for the money we are not just being descriptive
6697, NOTFUNNY, ### and you all have chosen your own instruments to fulfill this mission of creating a better world
14224, FUNNY, ### and i recently said that to a venture capitalist casually at some valley event to which he replied how quaint
14485, NOTFUNNY, ### after all it is as old as existence itself
2617, NOTFUNNY, ### and i'm sure those architects are inspired as i am by what surrounds us by nature
5072, FUNNY, ### when we started out i thought i was going to find so much corruption i was literally going to either die or get killed in the process
3328, NOTFUNNY, ### so sometimes i view from the inside like and the inner circles
11686, FUNNY, ### and so we've treated them as these second class ecosystems because they have very little monetary value and of course they're known to harbor alligators and snakes which i'll admit these aren't the most cuddly of ambassadors
7509, NOTFUNNY, ### again that means we're not listening to each other
3058, FUNNY, ### and these are our thai tulips
1989, NOTFUNNY, ### i essentially became an infant in a woman's body
8161, NOTFUNNY, ### and of course if all else fails you can just run off and enjoy a fun fiesta
2317, NOTFUNNY, ### i've done it for years
9819, NOTFUNNY, ### try to spot the beehive
1233, NOTFUNNY, ### it's about how many shining eyes i have around me
3549, NOTFUNNY, ### so they think it's actually very deadly
5218, NOTFUNNY, ### it is rare to get an exogenous investment in girls' education
11363, NOTFUNNY, ### my team is tired
433, NOTFUNNY, ### one billion grains of sand come into existence in the world each second
9469, NOTFUNNY, ### so i decided to reclaim ownership of sound and to put it into my art practice
13121, NOTFUNNY, ### poetry matters
6637, NOTFUNNY, ### so if you work hard and have a good career if you work really really really hard you'll have a great career
159, FUNNY, ### thousands of people just jumped on the train on our second channel like this
1470, FUNNY, ### okay
7578, FUNNY, ### and i always feel rather smug then
13399, NOTFUNNY, ### now in this search we were trying to actually find the dry limit for life on earth a place so dry that nothing was able to survive in it
14855, NOTFUNNY, ### and to get a reward a drop of orange juice that monkeys love this animal has to detect select one of these objects by touching not by seeing it by touching it because every time this virtual hand touches one of the objects an electrical pulse goes back to the brain of the animal describing the fine texture of the surface of this object so the animal can judge what is the correct object that he has to grab and if he does that he gets a reward without moving a muscle
4277, FUNNY, ### this is roger ailes
12229, NOTFUNNY, ### but that didn't happen
3481, NOTFUNNY, ### we would love to think that your brain could tell whether you need to lose weight or not but it can't
5328, NOTFUNNY, ### they are residing in the person who is designing that form
1312, FUNNY, ### and this is a guy from salt lake city this is what they look like out there
4848, NOTFUNNY, ### see in the real world math isn't necessarily done by mathematicians
8335, FUNNY, ### and i talked them into funding an expedition
8670, FUNNY, ### we can flip lorries coaches buses anything over with a nitrogen cannon with enough power
5709, NOTFUNNY, ### one is an hand axe from half a million years ago of the kind made by homo
3792, FUNNY, ### what she discovered just by being curiously aware when she smoked was that smoking tastes like shit
5156, FUNNY, ### they then paved them
15424, NOTFUNNY, ### these are the original windows of the hall of the sala grande
12926, FUNNY, ### lacking any coherent scientific argument for their case fall back on the popular phobia against atheism teach your children evolution in biology class and they'll soon move on to drugs grand larceny and sexual pre version
12640, FUNNY, ### we gave them our email address suggesting that if they write us we'll send them a free molecule
14384, FUNNY, ### every town that has a volunteer fire department understands this way of thinking
14143, FUNNY, ### the psychiatrist says all right you're ugly
10036, NOTFUNNY, ### openness is about collaboration
444, FUNNY, ### the last painting i'm going to talk about is called anonymous by anonymous
4553, FUNNY, ### she recognized prince from television and soon i had an audience of other hairdressers interested in meeting me
332, FUNNY, ### abrams
3967, NOTFUNNY, ### all this is being recorded on her time log
7304, NOTFUNNY, ### but nevertheless those sorts of things are out there
14742, FUNNY, ### and if the partner puts pressure on them so if the partner starts spitting water and intimidating them then the choices go down
13408, FUNNY, ### and you see these notes in my hand because i'm also a black preacher
2715, NOTFUNNY, ### and you have to tell me which one
5640, FUNNY, ### i don't want you to see what i'm doing up here
13691, NOTFUNNY, ### now this is a very attractive idea and the molecules they mention sound really science y
8890, FUNNY, ### that would be a fun thing to do
13304, NOTFUNNY, ### people wonder you know how do you have time to do this and so on
12049, NOTFUNNY, ### or in other words i sometimes say fire needs air
15337, FUNNY, ### let me tell you how i feel when i see my wrinkles in the mirror and i realize that some parts of me have dropped and i can't find them down there
1350, FUNNY, ### but to the second question half of them that didn't like it they wanted it to continue
10992, NOTFUNNY, ### so i think all people we need that but especially i look at people like me you know like i mean latinos we're about to be the majority in like two weeks
6823, NOTFUNNY, ### but she's in constant pain
1641, NOTFUNNY, ### and i thought about my relationship with my wife with my friends with people
2139, FUNNY, ### i don't know the million man swim
4972, FUNNY, ### i understand i said that the japanese do not put sugar in their green tea but i'd like to put some sugar in my green tea
10833, NOTFUNNY, ### and as we heard yesterday that's the pandora's box that's getting human beings in trouble and we're starting to see it with them
11351, NOTFUNNY, ### which means that no matter how destructive and terrible violence is if people see it as their only choice they will use it
12560, NOTFUNNY, ### and this continued through the entire magazine
8107, FUNNY, ### so this is the problem
8839, FUNNY, ### but what happens as this occurs is that we lose our magnetic field around the earth over the period of about years and that means that all these cosmic rays and particles that are to come streaming at us from the sun that this field protects us from are well basically we're gonna fry
8658, FUNNY, ### but this one it has a breath and a heartbeat and it feels very organic
10699, NOTFUNNY, ### i am constantly stunned by major breaches of trust the news corp phone hacking the volkswagen emissions scandal the widespread abuse in the catholic church the fact that only one measly banker went to jail after the great financial crisis or more recently the panama papers that revealed how the rich can exploit offshore tax regimes
2435, FUNNY, ### it's a lot of fun
6045, NOTFUNNY, ### and i'm honored to meet you the future leaders of great britain and this world
9581, FUNNY, ### a force more powerful is a video game that while you're playing it it teaches you how to engage in non violent insurrection and regime change
6000, FUNNY, ### i started turning it over in my head and i realized wait a minute my head actually fits inside this thing
15369, NOTFUNNY, ### ahh we come upon them the clandestine lovers
5682, FUNNY, ### was fatter than a telephone directory busy pumping hot air into the bubble
5668, NOTFUNNY, ### i was given an opportunity to design an exhibit for the unions of america and canada in washington and i did it on the condition that they become my partners in the future and help me with all future metal buildings etc
1249, NOTFUNNY, ### if you really care about starting a movement have the courage to follow and show others how to follow
12776, FUNNY, ### there's actually a gentleman in the front row who's doing a perfect imitation of her look
9056, NOTFUNNY, ### and he'd get them comfortable with that
13368, FUNNY, ### and no this isn't burning man or san francisco
7358, FUNNY, ### now the american population can be broken up into three main categories there's mostly wonderful people haters and florida
2791, NOTFUNNY, ### if you experience a catastrophic loss and you feel terrible and six months later you can barely function at all then it's probably a depression that was triggered by the catastrophic circumstances

5367, NOTFUNNY, ### foreign policy can never be the same again
3010, NOTFUNNY, ### there'll be a satellite called tess that will discover planets outside of our solar system

6008, NOTFUNNY, ### i didn't have an easy time finding friends to play with and i ended up making a lot of my own play
5902, FUNNY, ### now the daily show with john stewart is by far the most it's by far the most well documented example of the effectiveness of this kind of comedy
13976, FUNNY, ### and so even if we make those very important decisions for very silly reasons it remains statistically true that there are more georges living in georgia and there are more becoming dentists and there are more who are married to paul than statistically viable
14664, FUNNY, ### and given average demographics i think what that means is most of the people who saw me on that show are now dead
1737, NOTFUNNY, ### that enables him as a choreographer to do cool stuff to do new things because he has represented it
3047, NOTFUNNY, ### then the internet revolution brought us computing power data networks unprecedented access to information and communication and our lives have never been the same
14443, FUNNY, ### she said who is this charles bonnet she said did he have them himself and she said tell all the nurses that i have charles bonnet syndrome
13362, NOTFUNNY, ### and this has plunged journalism into crisis forcing those institutions to reexamine how they function
8619, NOTFUNNY, ### how do i know this here's my story
1901, FUNNY, ### there were rejected sheep that didn't meet sheep like criteria and were thrown out of the flock
13979, NOTFUNNY, ### in that year what i did do a lot was look at all sorts of surveys looking at a lot of data on this subject
4983, NOTFUNNY, ### i'd like to discuss some of these assumptions and the problems associated with them
1185, FUNNY, ### it's a very strange sensation having another creature try and eat you and there are few things that promote vegetarianism like that
14857, FUNNY, ### i'm just going to show you two of them
3819, NOTFUNNY, ### so there's tom dick and harry and they're working construction
10829, NOTFUNNY, ### so i built the vending machine
1194, NOTFUNNY, ### he wraps it around my leg picks me up a second time walks me to a vehicle and he's able to get me to medical attention
11793, NOTFUNNY, ### that's true
11628, FUNNY, ### my great grew up quite close to the edge of the niger river
11847, NOTFUNNY, ### i made a really stupid kind of mistake that most old males do when they think they're immortal and i got a bad case of the bends and was paralyzed and had to be flown back for treatment
11353, NOTFUNNY, ### my colleague and mentor gene sharp has identified methods of nonviolent action
8771, NOTFUNNY, ### people talked
480, NOTFUNNY, ### i started with money
1243, FUNNY, ### and i could list more
5465, NOTFUNNY, ### only in a flamingo can the reproduce so to get there it manipulates its shrimp hosts into forming these conspicuous colored swarms that are easier for a flamingo to spot and to devour and that is the secret of the swarm
12420, FUNNY, ### you need to air out your pussycat
1331, NOTFUNNY, ### many of you have probably heard about so i'll just say briefly that is a tool that allows researchers to edit genes very precisely easily and quickly
13911, FUNNY, ### and we would smile at each other in sympathy this camaraderie of the doomed
10804, FUNNY, ### if shivering is a form of meditation then i would consider myself a monk
6288, FUNNY, ### in case you're finished with toilet paper you can tear off the inside of the wall
8380, FUNNY, ### and as i have shown earlier our robot took the sentences from the textbooks and combined them together and it to produce an essay without understanding a thing
14292, FUNNY, ### and the truth is that no one really cares what you say when you're that age
9618, FUNNY, ### but when i was feeling confident and suave i would knock my height down a notch just to give the competition a chance
4200, FUNNY, ### because i'm thinking if i'm gay and i'm doing something that's going to destroy civilization i need to figure out what this stuff is and i need to stop doing it right now
4589, FUNNY, ### and that's i'm just telling you this is not good
1247, NOTFUNNY, ### that's silly
6429, FUNNY, ### of course talking about goats makes me think of sheep and not in good ways
2762, FUNNY, ### okay now this gives one a little pause
7360, NOTFUNNY, ### it's a website that denounces terrorism every day of the week while taking the weekends off
8873, NOTFUNNY, ### what's turned out to be really exciting is that our ability to come up with novel solutions to complex problems is hugely enhanced by a night of sleep
13712, NOTFUNNY, ### and that's just the way it is
128, FUNNY, ### al gore eat your heart out
2610, FUNNY, ### and should that pig have grown unfortunately it was dead it would have certainly been dead after i x rayed it with the amount of radiation i used anyway

3021, NOTFUNNY, ### you can see my fellow riders at the end of the picture looking at me with some concern
14426, NOTFUNNY, ### he looked like a man who wanted to wear an outfit that would convince me that he was very sane
13978, NOTFUNNY, ### it was a little bit too funky and we wanted a more feminine point of view and employed a duck who did it in a much more fitting way fashion
9605, NOTFUNNY, ### and there's no particular reason why we have to start with this seed shape we can use any seed shape we like
15429, FUNNY, ### so we brought back the innovation of having due dates

2651, NOTFUNNY, ### so my father's father was one of resnick brothers

4000, FUNNY, ### i remember i decided to write my why the world isn't flat article because i was being interviewed on tv in and the first question to me was professor why do you still believe that the world is round and i started laughing because i hadn't come across that formulation before
9641, NOTFUNNY, ### here i'm showing an artist's conception of a

13894, FUNNY, ### woo
6988, NOTFUNNY, ### does this sound familiar it's exactly what we're worrying about now with social media and drone cameras and of course
8175, FUNNY, ### then you can of course always go and see this guy
3336, NOTFUNNY, ### and listen to this coincidence he was the same guy who added the sixth string to what would later be called the spanish guitar
7524, NOTFUNNY, ### now i know that many of you don't stop to think about diversity in agricultural systems and let's face it that's logical

13354, NOTFUNNY, ### and a paper population is no different
14326, NOTFUNNY, ### therefore it has to blame itself a wordless blame which is more difficult to really resolve the wordless self blame
13419, NOTFUNNY, ### and yet all the while still we continue in the same vein the same vein that contradicts everything that we just admitted
13951, FUNNY, ### and as soon as they saw me they said we need a faster processor and a better mouse

11112, FUNNY, ### okay it's not obvious to be honest
14755, NOTFUNNY, ### and the emotional part
9312, NOTFUNNY, ### so how we eradicated smallpox was mass vaccination wouldn't work
13890, FUNNY, ### today's talk is about brains and yay i have a brain fan out there
14491, FUNNY, ### with that amount of time ancient egyptians could have built pyramids of giza

9583, NOTFUNNY, ### one of them is that every society has an ecological footprint
2680, FUNNY, ### danny hillis actually has an update on that he says technology is anything that doesn't quite work yet
4399, NOTFUNNY, ### but when you think about it the only environment in which that would be true would be a flat desert empty of any other life
2104, NOTFUNNY, ### this comes from the greek root
13805, NOTFUNNY, ### human beings have a need for maintaining consistency of the mass

13474, FUNNY, ### from behind i didn't appear to be either to her
12335, NOTFUNNY, ### in his book paul charges business and industry as one the major culprit in causing the decline of the biosphere and two the only institution that is large enough and pervasive enough and powerful enough to really lead humankind out of this mess
11219, NOTFUNNY, ### can't even get them out the door and i'm being serious
485, FUNNY, ### but there's always this illusion that if you buy this lamp you will live in a world without cords

9199, NOTFUNNY, ### so tina still married but thinking cord didn't love her flew to argentina with max
6287, NOTFUNNY, ### i work with surgical teams

1807, NOTFUNNY, ### it's not a happy thought but your kids could get mixed up in gangs or bad scenes
12859, NOTFUNNY, ### thank you for staying here

1698, FUNNY, ### upon his death in a quarter of the items were sold off for compote to a high class hotel restaurant
14831, FUNNY, ### maybe it runs in the family
4566, FUNNY, ### in contrast of course we have the hippo generation
6066, NOTFUNNY, ### now the reason i say this is because one of the effects of the current culture here if i can say so has been to de professionalize teachers
7107, FUNNY, ### two women together they have an argument
4966, NOTFUNNY, ### the thing is this idea of chinese american food doesn't exist only in america
1561, NOTFUNNY, ### she was facing the question of what to do with this child
2568, NOTFUNNY, ### the only downside is that it requires you to know how to text send a text message
9963, NOTFUNNY, ### we're going to go through four value shifts that we see driving new consumer behaviors that offer new management principles
12143, FUNNY, ### stay tuned for that
14084, FUNNY, ### by the way feel free to check in on my head at any time
4905, NOTFUNNY, ### and i certainly didn't do myself any favors
13318, FUNNY, ### you can see this most clearly when you take away someone's watch and you shut them into a bunker deep underground for a couple of months
72, FUNNY, ### eventually it got so out of hand that a local newspaper came and did a story on the dark side of nintendo starring me
12767, NOTFUNNY, ### they collect millions of points at a time with very high accuracy and very high resolution
9944, NOTFUNNY, ### but in prison he started to work hard
8744, FUNNY, ### she goes back to reading her book which is unfortunately titled rape
10319, FUNNY, ### i deleted the game two dots and nearly cried
7347, NOTFUNNY, ### there are patterns to life and they are shared
7338, NOTFUNNY, ### we have the vision
11084, NOTFUNNY, ### there are all sorts of techniques you will use and again this is a different kind of branching
8785, NOTFUNNY, ### i want to see what happens with those words
15387, NOTFUNNY, ### so i just want to show you some of the responses we've elicited from animals in the deep sea
15215, FUNNY, ### it's amazing
12296, NOTFUNNY, ### and i got several answers and i accepted the one which was farthest from home and practically i thought halfway to america
13925, NOTFUNNY, ### let me introduce him
9577, FUNNY, ### this is the yew no i'm just kidding this is the yew
6407, FUNNY, ### this is a more sophisticated version of it depends
4416, FUNNY, ### but in today's world sex plus pill equals no baby
9491, NOTFUNNY, ### so when you're watching a movie and a phone rings it's not actually ringing
3953, NOTFUNNY, ### it's been there for three days and it's laying on its back
5771, NOTFUNNY, ### so this production was seen by tom morris of the national theatre in london
15148, NOTFUNNY, ### and what they did at the institute was publish every step of the way
7369, NOTFUNNY, ### every generation is twice as well off as its parents'
9972, FUNNY, ### when dancing with the stars first hit the airwaves that is not what it looked like
2930, NOTFUNNY, ### and by my reckoning that is not a good thing
14851, FUNNY, ### flight control is brazilian
15514, NOTFUNNY, ### i did this series of calendars for shiseido
2046, NOTFUNNY, ### it's because of these things that we are able to be hopeful open receptive and shape shifting
14186, FUNNY, ### now all of the babies even in berkley like the crackers and don't like the raw broccoli
9290, NOTFUNNY, ### it was ubiquitous
8124, FUNNY, ### so i picked computers
14666, FUNNY, ### and i know how deeply annoying it is so karma does work
15036, NOTFUNNY, ### so i did a pre test when they came
7541, FUNNY, ### you sir come on up
3900, FUNNY, ### now the ones that show that needle programs aren't effective you think that's one of these annoying dynamic slides and i'm going to press my and the rest of it's going to come up but no that's the whole slide
781, NOTFUNNY, ### the other was indian cricket
14928, FUNNY, ### i have three girls and they just they it's like a rescue animal thing they're going there
11577, NOTFUNNY, ### and one night i found myself having a beer with pete and pete was looking at me and he just said you know mom i don't know selling group insurance is just not my passion
5381, NOTFUNNY, ### and about years went by
6226, FUNNY, ### that means something i don't know what
6127, NOTFUNNY, ### the waterproofing is done perfectly better than our city contractors because not a single drop should go waste in this
7960, FUNNY, ### they kind of have this vault where they're stored in high and george lucas did all the sound effects
2943, NOTFUNNY, ### because although i've used scientific terms in songs it's very difficult sometimes to make them lyrical
33, NOTFUNNY, ### and i framed it with color so you would not confuse it with advertising
14371, FUNNY, ### but if you were to float by in space on a space holiday and you heard this you want to get moving
10815, FUNNY, ### any of you guys called kevin it's a major lift from being called kevin to be called conqueror of the classics
3665, FUNNY, ### i mean there are people who name their companies after him
4937, NOTFUNNY, ### it's weird they were all done with about people
8022, NOTFUNNY, ### so it turned out that my fantasy about an entertaining life of being the wasn't going to come true
1168, FUNNY, ### and on top of all off these rules they keep changing
7152, NOTFUNNY, ### it really was a big idea in technology when we started applying it in the for the disabled community
12500, FUNNY, ### for instance me and my sister when we were little we would compete to see who could eat the most squirrel brains
5581, NOTFUNNY, ### so the jodie foster character here is actually this woman jill tarter and jill has dedicated her life to this
396, NOTFUNNY, ### the snow and the ice were my sandbox and the inuit were my teachers
1716, NOTFUNNY, ### in fact for the last three half million years the tools that we've had have been completely passive
4619, FUNNY, ### so you age because you rust out
9135, NOTFUNNY, ### and that rooftop did not have any ceiling only half a tin sheet
3125, FUNNY, ### in other words we want to leave the option open for there being a giant elephant at the center of our galaxy
14159, NOTFUNNY, ### but the arab spring has changed all that in uprisings which have blossomed across the region since
5804, FUNNY, ### if you have a compass on venus and mars congratulations you're lost
13331, FUNNY, ### so i thought i'd start with a love poem about prime numbers
2023, NOTFUNNY, ### but people like cities are resilient and no amount of legislation or intimidation or violence can fully eliminate any of us
12263, NOTFUNNY, ### she also had no face
12930, FUNNY, ### instead what i want to urge upon you is militant atheism
12007, FUNNY, ### i really loved this idea and i somehow was not focused on the idea that librarians as a class are sort of interested in spelling and i don't know
1886, FUNNY, ### yeah
4460, FUNNY, ### where it turns out you know a tremendous amount about almost nothing
8778, FUNNY, ### it also allows us to go to the store and allows us to get milk and eggs and cheese when what we're really looking for is red bull and bacon
13035, FUNNY, ### the first step is to recognize that we have a problem
4759, NOTFUNNY, ### and puzzling it is
15240, NOTFUNNY, ### they still are confined to terrible terrible limitations but schooling is there in the world today
5654, FUNNY, ### the health club is fastened to the garage with a c clamp for cleveland
4240, FUNNY, ### and i started having these bizarre dinner parties on friday nights where people would come over and we'd do extractions and i would capture them on video because it created this kind of funny portrait as well
2291, NOTFUNNY, ### i went from deciding to full blown planning very quickly
3323, NOTFUNNY, ### i was not born with a blade in my hand
7483, NOTFUNNY, ### things that go bump in the night nicole no
3997, NOTFUNNY, ### it turned into a contest
10936, FUNNY, ### of them volunteered immediately
11984, NOTFUNNY, ### because unlike say the heart or the intestines you really can't say very much about a brain by just looking at it at least with the naked eye
12415, FUNNY, ### like the bermuda triangle nobody ever reports back from there
10835, NOTFUNNY, ### then they leave the machine spits up more coins and peanuts and life is dandy if you're a crow you can come back anytime and get yourself a peanut
2378, NOTFUNNY, ### so when i'm really doing something that is actually just a waste of time in my mess of a life i'm too tied into my story that got me out of bed and ideally i ought to have some very complex story map in my mind you know with and a matrix of computation and the like but that is not how stories work
5644, FUNNY, ### i got into fish
7641, NOTFUNNY, ### and the more i thought of it the more i realized it was clearly not the digital information that was the bad guy here it was simply the display position that was separating me from my friend and that was binding those kids together
11786, FUNNY, ### we are trying to shoot lasers into the brain
3266, FUNNY, ### it was a bit like being in a hotel but with very food
4525, FUNNY, ### and she said yes
2123, NOTFUNNY, ### outside we'd have to rehearse running away or learn to stay still like statues giving no clues that we were there
13733, FUNNY, ### it's just that when we agree about our hallucinations we call that reality
7776, FUNNY, ### our lives were one part cuckoo's nest one part and one part a beautiful mind
13046, NOTFUNNY, ### when i left a guy passed me who had a chicago flag badge on his backpack
7315, NOTFUNNY, ### years ago we had to give up the idea that we are the center of the universe when the earth started to go around the sun years ago with darwin we had to give up the idea we were different from animals
11805, FUNNY, ### this is my grandmother and this is where i get this mouth
1366, NOTFUNNY, ### it's the fundamental law and this incredibly long series of accidents or chance outcomes that are there in addition
12249, NOTFUNNY, ### he's got it he's got it he's got it on his head
9771, FUNNY, ### now i am the first to acknowledge that statistics has got somewhat of an image problem
2383, FUNNY, ### now polls show that men tell twice as many lies as women assuming the women they asked told the truth
7496, NOTFUNNY, ### now i'm going to put on the blindfold
2734, NOTFUNNY, ### my father too was a refugee
14743, FUNNY, ### she gives a rock to us now gets again cucumber
3228, FUNNY, ### let's say you're there's alzheimer's in your family so you've likely inherited a gene or two that tips your scale arm a bit you've been burning the candle at both ends for years you love bacon and you don't run unless someone's chasing you
7229, FUNNY, ### and then i said and i really don't think my due date is accurate
4563, NOTFUNNY, ### mara was a driving force behind that movement
2408, FUNNY, ### and you know that chris would say thank you
5187, FUNNY, ### it turns out it is also used on when people are role playing as dogs
824, FUNNY, ### and ikea is a store with kind of okay furniture that takes a long time to assemble
9229, NOTFUNNY, ### we thought it's cool that we can use software to visualize tiny motions like this and you can almost think of it as a way to extend our sense of touch
14662, NOTFUNNY, ### all right boys take it away
7224, FUNNY, ### no dad you've only told me times and twice it wasn't my fault
15261, NOTFUNNY, ### it isn't when the shiny new tools show up that their uses start permeating society
4336, FUNNY, ### and i think in many ways we can sort of think of the use of the blue shell and the mayans as the first real application of the technology
4641, NOTFUNNY, ### we can do it
4644, NOTFUNNY, ### i was an athlete
10568, FUNNY, ### so basically china is a sick bric country
7398, FUNNY, ### mishawaka is many good things but cultural hub of the world it is not so my only exposure to theater and film was limited to the plays i did in high school and blockbuster video may she rest in peace
12712, FUNNY, ### he's yours forever
182, FUNNY, ### isn't that mind blowing i bet you will never look at that black truffle again without thinking of its genes
11142, FUNNY, ### i don't think they thought i'd grow up to sell insurance
10940, NOTFUNNY, ### this boy here in the middle of central india this is in a village where the children recorded their own music and then played it back to each other and in the process they've enjoyed themselves thoroughly
3651, NOTFUNNY, ### all this noise around us actually has information
4679, NOTFUNNY, ### occasionally in america i hear people saying sir richard and think there's some shakespearean play taking place
8924, FUNNY, ### here you are
13833, NOTFUNNY, ### so it's god nothing the world
5159, NOTFUNNY, ### the first is in the capital city of brazil brasilia
2399, FUNNY, ### and i'm gonna try and do that within the time span that we were told to stay within and to follow the ted commandments that is actually something that creates a near death experience but near death is good for creativity
12463, FUNNY, ### discouraging data on the antidepressant
1929, FUNNY, ### and this is about the most exciting thing in my life right now which is perhaps a sad commentary on my life
1767, FUNNY, ### when i was younger mostly in my teens and i had strange ideas about feminists as hairy angry man hating sex hating women as if those are bad things
989, FUNNY, ### we went from a production economy to a service economy
13098, FUNNY, ### we went to home depot well over a hundred times
14550, NOTFUNNY, ### we can do anything you ask
15198, FUNNY, ### he wanted to go out and do an experiment
6742, FUNNY, ### something happened along the line
7782, NOTFUNNY, ### the conventional thinking has been that trauma leads to distress and there's been a lot of focus on the resulting dysfunction
217, NOTFUNNY, ### but it ended up in this very long protracted legal battle and there i was after five years fighting against parliament in front of three of britain's most eminent high court judges waiting for their ruling about whether or not parliament had to release this data
2118, FUNNY, ### i was crushed as if by a trash compactor
7098, NOTFUNNY, ### but i know it's going to happen
4165, NOTFUNNY, ### but then there was another wonderfully pretentious article that came out in the new republic so pretentious by leibovitz and it said moma has mistaken video games for art
1707, FUNNY, ### and by the way it's no accident that the drone body looks just like the pelvis of a flying squirrel
1225, NOTFUNNY, ### i was working with this young pianist and said the trouble with you is you're a two buttock player
757, NOTFUNNY, ### is a very elegant molecule
57, NOTFUNNY, ### if you designate a spot and you're scrupulous about it your things will always be there when you look for them
13526, FUNNY, ### oh i forgot i shouldn't shuffle but i think actually my technique is to peek all the time
2940, FUNNY, ### and there's few things more thrilling than playing a song for the first time in front of an audience especially when it's half finished
3488, FUNNY, ### and that was the finishing post right there
8249, NOTFUNNY, ### i have worked with young people who manifest hope and promise despite being at the effect of racist discipline practices in their schools and police violence in their communities
11106, NOTFUNNY, ### and they say in their discussion that this is very likely because freaks get published
15381, NOTFUNNY, ### and the first thing you're going to see is a transect screen that is about a meter across
8395, NOTFUNNY, ### so i hope to pierce that prejudice forever with this group
9532, FUNNY, ### alright
3357, NOTFUNNY, ### this is a picture of times square in the and despite all of the technological innovation cultural changes political changes this is times square in
7711, FUNNY, ### and so what you've seen today is less than a fraction of one percent of what is in here and in the ted lab we have a tour that was created by a six named benjamin that will knock your socks off
15456, FUNNY, ### it's cold it's eerie it's misty it might be raining and you might be standing on the shores of lake michigan brimming with paint thinner
12215, NOTFUNNY, ### and ask yourself what problem have you solved ever that was worth solving where you knew all of the given information in advance where you didn't have a surplus of information and you had to filter it out or you didn't have sufficient information and had to go find some
6227, NOTFUNNY, ### and so what i thought i'd do is i'll explain four sort of problems about it and then i'll suggest a solution which hopefully you might find interesting
14459, FUNNY, ### and i said well they don't all hate it
8303, NOTFUNNY, ### it's not about mythology or myself to you
7195, FUNNY, ### the other half will tell you they don't like the question
12488, NOTFUNNY, ### when we're in a playful mood we want excitement
1909, FUNNY, ### weird
3942, NOTFUNNY, ### i know this is a hard night for you guys
6797, NOTFUNNY, ### so what that means is one could use computational methods to read all of the books in a click of a button
9536, NOTFUNNY, ### so this morning i'm going to share two of these problems and talk about where they stand
7815, NOTFUNNY, ### he said ok we're going to start having these meetings
9181, NOTFUNNY, ### when it was uncovered it ushered in a new era of streamlined futuristic design called which came to be synonymous with the jet age a misnomer
1402, FUNNY, ### what a fish
9655, FUNNY, ### this study from used blood tests to confirm that the serotonin levels of the newly in love very closely resembled the serotonin levels of people who had been diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorder
11537, FUNNY, ### the proof of that is a great party trick that admittedly only works at certain parties
9539, NOTFUNNY, ### and if you throw in other durable goods like automobiles and so forth that number well more than doubles
4018, NOTFUNNY, ### and it lets us look at our world in a completely new way
10891, NOTFUNNY, ### insulation better design
7934, FUNNY, ### now california's considering similar legislation and this would make sure that the autonomous car is not one of those things that has to stay in vegas
6602, NOTFUNNY, ### but that's an interesting thing for a creative person
5592, NOTFUNNY, ### and what i want to do in this talk is to split them apart figuring out when they diverge and how they converge
3048, FUNNY, ### come back start again
6561, FUNNY, ### right at the center of the reagan years that's we're there's we've it's
606, FUNNY, ### they would dress the robots
11004, FUNNY, ### in fact the words wrong number were more popular than the word hello
8419, FUNNY, ### i'm teasing
14856, FUNNY, ### never mind that this is what you'll actually produce if you attempt to work at a computer with a baby on your lap
14601, NOTFUNNY, ### we were told we were assured that the more meat and dairy and poultry we ate the healthier we'd be
7356, NOTFUNNY, ### and so on many occasions i've been asked by people you know you're suffering why don't you move back they don't understand
6081, NOTFUNNY, ### it's about the size of a rugby ball
4207, NOTFUNNY, ### not the drag queen part i am not shaving my hair for anyone but the gay part
8065, FUNNY, ### and they wouldn't let the other half out to go look for the first half because they were afraid they wouldn't come back
9401, NOTFUNNY, ### and it seemed that whenever there was a camera around or a video or film camera it was a great deal harder to do for those in power to bury the story
7917, NOTFUNNY, ### it's a load of nonsense
6619, NOTFUNNY, ### on this map the colored areas represent water conflicts
5356, NOTFUNNY, ### so i'd about given up trying to get my hands on one of these
3290, FUNNY, ### and i'll never forget the day i was called in by a member of top management and told to stop associating with any known or suspected environmentalists
117, NOTFUNNY, ### he was stunned
12342, FUNNY, ### i decide consciously to raise my arm and the damn thing goes up
1725, NOTFUNNY, ### we're going to have a world with more variety more more dynamism more complexity more adaptability and of course more beauty
1286, FUNNY, ### it is a little bit like having a waste treatment plant right next to an amusement park
13424, NOTFUNNY, ### see here's the thing i had to figure out a way to shift cops that were under my tutelage from being occupiers of communities to being partners
12721, NOTFUNNY, ### they've had three other children
7977, NOTFUNNY, ### the second is observing people in real life situations and with them
5073, FUNNY, ### i like to think about these two years like a weight loss program
1263, FUNNY, ### cheating
13536, FUNNY, ### queen
2244, NOTFUNNY, ### the second reason is we think the problem is solved here in the us
2722, NOTFUNNY, ### so if i could have the lights down up here
3202, NOTFUNNY, ### i made a computer out of people
14193, NOTFUNNY, ### one thing that this baby could be thinking about that could be going on in his mind is trying to figure out what's going on in the mind of that other baby
142, FUNNY, ### and i'm thinking oh yeah the square root of the length is proportional to its period
11396, NOTFUNNY, ### it's quite dangerous but i believe it's better to have dangerous things in the open than think you're going to keep them secret
4092, NOTFUNNY, ### and happiness is a great motivator we strive for happiness
466, NOTFUNNY, ### i think he was just warning him actually
7532, NOTFUNNY, ### but what i've been doing when i was about i grew in my uncle's house
9101, FUNNY, ### this was the director of the bank when he was still smiling
14278, FUNNY, ### and we have this photograph posted in our lab in a place of honor with the caption engineer satisfying two women at once
4826, FUNNY, ### and we learned in this you don't really ever want to cross a nine year old girl with tanks
10920, FUNNY, ### now i love that word
12371, FUNNY, ### that completely destroys the relationship between the business and the sidewalk where the theoretical pedestrians are
2990, FUNNY, ### i never thought i'd be quoting boxer mike tyson on the ted stage but he once said everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face
4410, FUNNY, ### i'm not going to talk about that tonight
3121, NOTFUNNY, ### let's give him a name too nelson
10652, NOTFUNNY, ### it did mine
5634, NOTFUNNY, ### we never evolved to navigate in the world of atoms
19, NOTFUNNY, ### if we spread out the and weak charge and plot the charges of particles in this two dimensional charge space the electric charge is where these particles sit along the vertical direction
8864, FUNNY, ### well that's wrong at so many different levels
14699, FUNNY, ### but when i am working in my house and writing after a day's writing i rush downstairs and i'm very excited to talk about marcus garvey or bob marley and words are tripping out of my mouth like butterflies and i'm so excited that my children stop me and they say dad nobody cares
9802, FUNNY, ### now it's not always easy to push yourself and that's why they invented mothers
4539, NOTFUNNY, ### and others were mesmerized
10345, FUNNY, ### i got this
12402, NOTFUNNY, ### chinese outside your door the world is waiting
223, FUNNY, ### but of course the sikhs might give you a job on a platter the jews make it hard international competition phase one phase two phase three
12106, NOTFUNNY, ### i called it serious nonsense because on the serious side i use a technique of painstaking realism of editorial illustration from when i was a kid
12608, FUNNY, ### damn
4037, NOTFUNNY, ### we go into the cold war and we continue to try and build walls
8196, FUNNY, ### i know what you're going to say no one uses tape recorders nowadays
11920, NOTFUNNY, ### but you see that hyphen in teen age and that over and you know you're reading the new yorker
14859, NOTFUNNY, ### just put the term working mother into any image search engine stock photo site
15575, NOTFUNNY, ### it reshaped the demography of the globe in a way that no war ever has
6813, FUNNY, ### my friend danny hillis says kind of a similar one he says technology is anything that doesn't work yet
568, NOTFUNNY, ### whatever
6001, FUNNY, ### yeah i cut a hole out i put some acetate in there and i made myself a space helmet
10141, NOTFUNNY, ### this is what a classroom in a public school in india looks like
8118, NOTFUNNY, ### so we need a thread in school that talks about everything we don't know
4319, FUNNY, ### i have one of those
10150, NOTFUNNY, ### the hour from night to day
12943, NOTFUNNY, ### and rwanda has decided to become the technology hub or a technology hub on the continent
4549, FUNNY, ### so we set off on a mission to travel the world and look for the people we finally termed as the
4194, FUNNY, ### i knew enough that is to know that i'd be a tourist in the koran an informed one an experienced one even but still an outsider an agnostic jew reading someone else's holy book
4552, FUNNY, ### i had to come up with a strategy so that i could just pee in peace
3213, NOTFUNNY, ### i was like oh this my job
12026, NOTFUNNY, ### even larger animals eat insects
8599, NOTFUNNY, ### the rate of change today suggests that we may only have or years to adjust and if we don't react fast enough that means by the time today's elementary school students are college aged we could be living in a world that's robotic largely unemployed and stuck in kind of un great depression
2204, FUNNY, ### it will only make you worse than you already are
1042, FUNNY, ### so the modern equivalent would of course be this
9078, FUNNY, ### and here's a shot of me this is the before shot of me
5998, NOTFUNNY, ### i'd write software and then i'd go out in the field to places like the kansas city star where i would train users and get feedback
3320, FUNNY, ### so it's actually a that's nine yards long
9271, NOTFUNNY, ### take a bite
8362, FUNNY, ### it's very gratifying to have this kind of reception here
15477, NOTFUNNY, ### now the way we think about this problem matters
9894, FUNNY, ### upright walking ape as it was found at lake on the west side
2852, FUNNY, ### it's not really the magic kingdom
3539, FUNNY, ### thank you for that reaction
4422, NOTFUNNY, ### and as you're thinking about this incredible ability to make life do what you want it to do what it's programmed to do what you end up doing is taking what we've been doing for thousands of years which is breeding changing mixing matching all kinds of life forms and we accelerate it
11778, NOTFUNNY, ### it talked about how to build your own house how to grow your own food all kinds of things
5752, NOTFUNNY, ### well the problem was in thinking that the insect wings function in the way that aircraft wings work
11746, NOTFUNNY, ### now he needed accessories
1959, NOTFUNNY, ### the police minister's and a heap of public statements were made about it
1124, NOTFUNNY, ### and then pearl harbor happens and as if his life wasn't difficult enough now the race relations have really ratcheted up and then the japanese american internment camps are quickly created and there's lots of tension and horrible stuff as he's still trying to solve this murder
12040, FUNNY, ### and we think it's a given and toys and lingerie are going to save us with that
1319, FUNNY, ### and after a while if the viewer continues to remain in the space the panels will sort of become immune to the presence of the viewer and become lax and autonomous again until they sort of sense a presence in the room or a movement when they will again snap to attention
3718, FUNNY, ### sort of an alternating tripod and they can negotiate obstacles just like the animal
10556, NOTFUNNY, ### i have cancer
11850, NOTFUNNY, ### during that year i spent a lot of time learning about the physics and physiology of diving and how to overcome these limitations
7248, FUNNY, ### oliver was an extremely dashing handsome charming and largely unstable male that i completely lost my heart to
170, NOTFUNNY, ### so that's strong and living tv
4177, FUNNY, ### by the way nasa has a space archaeology program so it's a real job
15319, NOTFUNNY, ### i believe it turned out for the best
6010, NOTFUNNY, ### and it's so beautiful to watch
11278, FUNNY, ### then finally she said the third thing i want you to promise me is that you'll never drink alcohol
7594, NOTFUNNY, ### the fact is this is not enough
5088, FUNNY, ### he said there are two types of people in this world those who divide the world into two types and those who do not
14806, NOTFUNNY, ### your brain is locked in a vault of silence and darkness inside your skull
14693, NOTFUNNY, ### turns out it's a big deal
10293, NOTFUNNY, ### to put it into perspective if you compare this to the soldiers in iraq for instance right now fighting the war
6494, NOTFUNNY, ### and that tennis if i was fortunate enough to become number one and i knew being a girl it would be harder to have influence already at that age that i had this platform
15378, FUNNY, ### personally i think it's something sexy
15247, FUNNY, ### now when we tried to challenge this going to the supreme court getting the supreme court the bunch of conservatives there if we could get them to wake up to this to strike it down we had the assistance of nobel prize winners including this right wing nobel prize winner milton friedman who said he would join our brief only if the word no brainer was in the brief somewhere
6301, FUNNY, ### which actually looked more like this
14761, NOTFUNNY, ### we take them out of the group put them in a test chamber
14809, NOTFUNNY, ### eighty six percent of them were below grade level in english and in math
8965, FUNNY, ### and as we walk in it is a scene i can only describe you as saying it looked like norway threw up
5840, FUNNY, ### all the students sat around and they went
10364, FUNNY, ### and in fact there's a thriving market in the partially eaten food of beloved people
13927, FUNNY, ### anyway i was really delighted to receive the invitation to present to you some of my music and some of my work as a composer presumably because it appeals to my well known and abundant narcissism
8988, FUNNY, ### these are q tips stuck to my roommate with wig glue
54, NOTFUNNY, ### i thought about calling a locksmith at least i had my cellphone but at midnight it could take a while for a locksmith to show up and it was cold
7183, FUNNY, ### but you know that makes me feel good because richard dawkins has told us how to treat a priesthood
2504, NOTFUNNY, ### and it was all very interesting but i wouldn't say it was spectacular
11235, NOTFUNNY, ### keep in mind conversations stop violence conversations start countries they build bridges and when the chips are down conversations are the last tools that humans use before they pick up their guns
1302, NOTFUNNY, ### and i'd just come back from living in spain for a while and i'd joined this fortune company
11210, FUNNY, ### we've got a new one this year but we'll work on that next season
10775, FUNNY, ### or is it now actually that's just another parochial misconception
1333, NOTFUNNY, ### but i want to share with you guys today my perspective as a geologist in how understanding earth's past can help inform and guide decisions that we make today about how to live on earth's surface
15220, NOTFUNNY, ### she could use it when she wanted in the way that she wanted at the dose and frequency that worked for her
11453, NOTFUNNY, ### and everybody wanted the work of social justice to be visible to the outside world
5515, FUNNY, ### now we've reached the subject of public transport and public transport here in dublin is a somewhat touchy subject
12471, FUNNY, ### it requires thinking on the part of the cartoonist and thinking on your part to make it into a cartoon
4071, NOTFUNNY, ### he's making a ton of money doing custom furniture for rich people
3925, NOTFUNNY, ### and he would say yes it is gretchen
13271, NOTFUNNY, ### i mean people have written about this phenomenon
9247, FUNNY, ### you've obviously never opened all the but all you have to type in is this little teeny window down here
5645, FUNNY, ### and after i got i was really drunk i was asked to do some sketches on napkins
5700, NOTFUNNY, ### and in some parts of this number is as high as nine out of girls being unaware of it
15293, NOTFUNNY, ### i'm the new governor
13219, FUNNY, ### if this was a group of beekeepers you would have everyone from the card carrying member who's you know live free or die to the you know the self expressed quirky san francisco backyard pig farmer
13640, NOTFUNNY, ### and then it also has the lowest drag coefficient of any car of its size
7212, NOTFUNNY, ### tourists in glass bottomed boats would be viewing the drowned towers of miami through feet of tropical water
3958, FUNNY, ### that way you save eight minutes every half hour so in the course of two hours of watching tv you find minutes to exercise
9015, FUNNY, ### so i wanted to follow that rule
14266, FUNNY, ### i'll look at it periodically
13885, NOTFUNNY, ### we have to have a very special technology to get into that unfamiliar world
9851, FUNNY, ### in the religious opinion religious orthodoxy is dismissed as self indulgent guesswork about matters that nobody can be certain of one way or the other but which makes people quarrelsome and stupidly sectarian
4993, NOTFUNNY, ### designers can materialize their ideas directly in and surgeons can practice on virtual organs underneath the screen
3172, FUNNY, ### we've got a million people on the site already so we can handle a few more
14587, NOTFUNNY, ### my first job in brazil was actually to develop a way to improve the readability of billboards and based on speed angle of approach and actually blocks of text
7181, FUNNY, ### and if you've got a scientific problem like that you can't solve it by holding a head count and saying more of us say yes than say no
5775, FUNNY, ### she's just laid it down nice and tidy
640, FUNNY, ### we just did that for a laugh just to see what happens
12315, FUNNY, ### anyway i came back from australia and despite the obvious risks to my health i moved to aberdeen
7485, NOTFUNNY, ### twice
5093, NOTFUNNY, ### if you said don't do this anymore they'd wonder what you're talking about
8178, NOTFUNNY, ### and they rang very true for me
10027, FUNNY, ### the reason i know this story is because he's my neighbor
3780, NOTFUNNY, ### i've done some tests
14803, NOTFUNNY, ### now what this means is that our experience of reality is constrained by our biology and that goes against the common sense notion that our eyes and our ears and our fingertips are just picking up the objective reality that's out there
13493, FUNNY, ### and the girl said they will in a minute
2704, NOTFUNNY, ### gene patents clearly were a problem and were harming patients
6586, FUNNY, ### interpreter this one is called instant noodles
8334, FUNNY, ### so i shelved it and i made this other movie about a big ship that sinks
6613, NOTFUNNY, ### usually i say no right away but some of them come with pedigree and they sound well intentioned and they get you for at least one or two meetings
7760, FUNNY, ### this is a woman in an electric wheelchair chasing a duck in circles on the road
12525, FUNNY, ### this is waterproofing the roof
12972, FUNNY, ### so this book that i have in my hand is a directory of everybody who had an email address in
9188, NOTFUNNY, ### and i think by this news has finally reached britain so i should probably add gordon brown to this list as well
9322, FUNNY, ### and then it was made worse there were two of them
5491, FUNNY, ### right and the methods it says then we put the bees into the fridge smiley face
7735, NOTFUNNY, ### and so we picked those two things and everything the foundation does is focused there
11658, FUNNY, ### he said and it's not me because i like you people
9682, FUNNY, ### the age of the universe between now and the big bang is a hundred billion in dog years
7056, FUNNY, ### don't get me wrong i like fish and tomatoes but this is just creepy
7549, NOTFUNNY, ### and we were showing him the same gel magnet that you're holding in your hand and you know we shared the same ideas
527, NOTFUNNY, ### fifty or so of them
10329, FUNNY, ### this particular reel it's an industrial video but it was shown in drive in theaters in in the detroit area in fact and it preceded alfred hitchcock's psycho
12338, FUNNY, ### this is a public budget
1199, NOTFUNNY, ### and i did
15411, NOTFUNNY, ### but as they learn to become adults they become much more sensitive to the opinions of others and they lose that freedom and they do start to become embarrassed
10485, NOTFUNNY, ### rosalind franklin was leaving in about two months and after she left he would start building models
9726, NOTFUNNY, ### it really depends on the exact timing the distances the locations and that's what makes it hard
11469, NOTFUNNY, ### but governments hate the economy and that's why i took this picture in and this is the same market in and i think when the organizers of this conference were talking about radical openness they didn't mean that the streets should be open and the people should be gone
638, FUNNY, ### now after five generations of applying evolutionary process the genetic algorithm is getting a tiny bit better
6368, NOTFUNNY, ### i started on this path years ago
10916, NOTFUNNY, ### and so the classroom started to feel a little bit small so we found an industrial site in hong kong and we turned it into the largest mega space focused on social and environmental impact
12940, NOTFUNNY, ### but i think actually the alternative is to grasp the nettle of the word atheism itself precisely because it is a taboo word carrying of hysterical phobia
3952, NOTFUNNY, ### this is a turkey in wisconsin on the premises of the ethan allen juvenile correctional institution
11321, FUNNY, ### and then when he paused and everyone looked at me for a response from a balcony perspective i was able to thank him for his remarks and say i appreciate your criticism of my country and i take it as a sign that we're among friends and can speak candidly to one another
4762, FUNNY, ### with no support from her husband she caused a sensation by taking him to court and prosecuting her own case and a far greater sensation when she won
13073, FUNNY, ### it's a cultural expression that for thousands of years has inspired human beings to think beyond the obvious
14406, FUNNY, ### so i was leafing through it wondering if i had any mental disorders and it turns out i've got
3263, NOTFUNNY, ### and in the library i found the images that really captured the zeitgeist of the great depression
10757, FUNNY, ### i'm going to destroy android because it's a stolen product
12546, FUNNY, ### i had requested slides kind of adamantly up till the pretty much last few days but was denied access to a slide projector
2890, FUNNY, ### the first thing i did upon awakening from that last surgery was to climb out of my crib and begin wandering around the intensive care nursery probably looking for the one who did this to me
688, NOTFUNNY, ### they started to see sustainability not just as important but crucial to business success
4694, FUNNY, ### so behave next year someone might say something nice about you
1141, FUNNY, ### in fact it would really in the absence of these machines have made the attendance here chris really quite sparse
633, NOTFUNNY, ### that's why i began investigating the most secretive and experimental prison units in the united states for so called second tier terrorists
9703, NOTFUNNY, ### but it's not unique to japan
2134, NOTFUNNY, ### my daily life became very hard but very simple
29, FUNNY, ### oh that guy just moved
14374, FUNNY, ### isn't that terrific so we've been as i say very successful very lucky in having companies catch the vision of this from cars car makers who want to put a stereo system in the front for the kids and a separate system in the back oh no the kids aren't driving today
122, NOTFUNNY, ### i test your ability to solve
10484, NOTFUNNY, ### he'll build a model and then we're going to be scooped
15483, NOTFUNNY, ### in the isaac asimov wrote his famous laws of robotics the three laws of robotics
8453, NOTFUNNY, ### but you might ask why was the higgs included in the standard model alongside well known particles like electrons and photons and quarks if it hadn't been discovered back then in the good question
13751, NOTFUNNY, ### it's made up of lots of little bits
3497, NOTFUNNY, ### this is one of my favorite ones here where they have rabbit breeding so males choose the lucky rabbit
8085, NOTFUNNY, ### they loaded up their mules and their horses
827, FUNNY, ### now everything was fine
11247, FUNNY, ### and the incredible thing about hyena shit is it makes great chalk
13791, FUNNY, ### i got that staircase for dollars including delivery to my lot
8944, NOTFUNNY, ### there's nothing in it for the ant
5476, NOTFUNNY, ### i felt great
8892, NOTFUNNY, ### and it's open to us to introduce a new way of doing that and that's what i'll talk about for minutes or whatever the time remains
14830, FUNNY, ### and so that project taught me another lesson about life which is that when in doubt improvise
11534, FUNNY, ### australians we don't mind a bit of a drink sometimes to excess leading to embarrassing social situations
3099, FUNNY, ### what is completely lacking is a class of people who have immense amounts of power but no money at all
4571, FUNNY, ### there is one particular quote a lesotho chief once said that here in lesotho we've got two problems rats and the government
12339, NOTFUNNY, ### my father was responsible for building roads in and he had developed a firm stance against corruption even though he was harassed and threatened
3692, FUNNY, ### when i learned some years ago that writers were expected to have had really unhappy childhoods to be successful i began to think about how i could invent horrible things my parents had done to me
7010, NOTFUNNY, ### so i have not a gospel of disruption or innovation or a triple bottom line
13740, FUNNY, ### the funny thing was we had to break into the parking lot too so we totally felt like we were legit in the whole graf scene too
1559, NOTFUNNY, ### and when she said it it made me anxious
1149, FUNNY, ### you're welcome
10799, FUNNY, ### therefore according to the logic of the reverse turing test gertrude stein is a computer
8796, FUNNY, ### short talk
11467, NOTFUNNY, ### that's his little depot behind him and he earns twice the nigerian minimum wage
3961, FUNNY, ### i'm sure many of you like me come december get cards that contain these folded up sheets of colored paper on which is written what is known as the family holiday letter
8515, NOTFUNNY, ### now the sock puppet on the other hand is a totally different animal
14222, NOTFUNNY, ### and we think that might be because adolescents and adults use a different mental approach a different cognitive strategy to make social decisions and one way of looking at that is to do behavioral studies whereby we bring people into the lab and we give them some kind of behavioral task and i'll just give you another example of the kind of task that we use in my lab
254, NOTFUNNY, ### now don't get me wrong i'm not for one minute suggesting that sharing data is a bad thing
10827, FUNNY, ### until they finally graduated and left campus and glad to get away i'm sure came back sometime later and found the crows still remembered them
8387, FUNNY, ### and it works look at these headlines
3878, NOTFUNNY, ### tissue is the calcium build up the calcium storage basically when an animal is pregnant when a bird is pregnant
6792, FUNNY, ### finally in someone woke up and realized that had gotten somewhat pass
7305, NOTFUNNY, ### at the bottom right is one that i built in my lab about years ago and we finally turned that into a product
8062, FUNNY, ### this was reinforced by the political climate of the time
199, NOTFUNNY, ### and i was left with this intense feeling of awe and exhilaration at the universe and our own ability to understand as much as we do
12516, NOTFUNNY, ### the next artist is kay and she's interested in and transience
12854, FUNNY, ### well maybe it's for you
4533, NOTFUNNY, ### we live five to six years shorter children have lung cancer when they're six years old
13180, FUNNY, ### that's an englishman asking an irishman to be succinct
9663, NOTFUNNY, ### they argue that metaphors really do shape the way we experience the world and that they can even act as a guide for future actions like self fulfilling prophecies
3101, FUNNY, ### moving over we come of course to consultancy
14936, NOTFUNNY, ### next is a compilation of a bunch of stuff
4349, NOTFUNNY, ### we filmed that process and aired a documentary
10744, NOTFUNNY, ### they never give you a challenge you can't achieve
8852, NOTFUNNY, ### and the chance that some of it isn't more intelligent than ours is also a remote idea

7989, FUNNY, ### it goes as far back into the past as because you never know
8517, NOTFUNNY, ### chinese water army refers to thousands of people in china that are paid small amounts of money to produce content
5551, FUNNY, ### it looks like this
9377, NOTFUNNY, ### but this guy named otto rohwedder invented sliced bread and he focused like most inventors did on the patent part and the making part
8790, NOTFUNNY, ### and then this last one one of my favorites this design

1356, FUNNY, ### i'll just mention it
4853, NOTFUNNY, ### and with a population increasing as quickly as it is and with the water supply from these glaciers because of climate change decreasing so much i think we have a real risk of instability

11672, NOTFUNNY, ### so that's where this field comes in that we call the field of medicine
12016, FUNNY, ### so that's one point for insects
12114, NOTFUNNY, ### i believe that such fears are unfounded
3432, NOTFUNNY, ### but in fact we've been finding in our own laboratory research that small psychological interventions small changes to people's values small nudges in certain directions can restore levels of egalitarianism and empathy

11414, NOTFUNNY, ### that was probably our first mistake
12664, NOTFUNNY, ### in response the american heritage dictionaries include usage notes
15276, NOTFUNNY, ### and he says it seems as if the ideal argument for most philosophers is you give your audience the premises and then you give them the inferences and the conclusion and if they don't accept the conclusion they die
1120, NOTFUNNY, ### clarity gets to the point
8342, FUNNY, ### and so that isn't very hard
5748, FUNNY, ### i think we have to compare we have to compare the size of the brain with what the brain can do
13866, FUNNY, ### this is the size of the earth going through that same frame
4524, FUNNY, ### i'm not going to propose don't worry
15496, FUNNY, ### school was great and maybe going to school helped me get to this media lab place i'm not sure
10510, FUNNY, ### but as bob hope put it i feel very humble but i think i have the strength of character to fight it
11325, NOTFUNNY, ### as i've spent the last better part of three decades almost four traveling the world trying to work getting involved in conflicts ranging from yugoslavia to the middle east to chechnya to venezuela some of the most difficult conflicts on the face of the planet i've been asking myself that question
13966, NOTFUNNY, ### now i question everything
9458, FUNNY, ### and this led me to thinking about three different kinds of nights last night overnight all night long
9886, FUNNY, ### and this is the only bicyclist that i met in pasadena so
3338, FUNNY, ### and the good news this one's a monster

14911, FUNNY, ### if you tell to people we want to be independent from fossil energy in our world people will laugh at you except here where crazy people are invited to speak
5703, NOTFUNNY, ### and in the absence of any intervention it is the myth and misconception that propagate from generation to generation
14548, NOTFUNNY, ### and anyway roll this little clip i'll just show you
2200, FUNNY, ### i don't think it's an ideal system
5104, NOTFUNNY, ### there's been a lot of talk about dreams over the course of these few days
3810, FUNNY, ### it makes sense now when i think about it because if you'd known my father you would've wanted to poison him too
2783, FUNNY, ### and maggie robbins said i used to volunteer in an aids clinic and i would just talk and talk and talk and the people i was dealing with weren't very responsive and i thought not very friendly or helpful of them
10852, NOTFUNNY, ### and it's a little bit like what you might see actors do when they try to mirror each other to find the right between them
15504, FUNNY, ### as you age from infant age your vision gets better and maybe in your late teens early twenties you're looking for a mate and your vision goes after that
7252, FUNNY, ### so then the choice becomes how do you well or do you poorly and poorly is all too common
1026, FUNNY, ### probably one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero
14454, FUNNY, ### so it's a slight misquote
1161, FUNNY, ### i made a physical version of bird that could never be taken off the app store
9762, NOTFUNNY, ### he wants to engineer success
10384, FUNNY, ### and she said i knew it was he

14097, FUNNY, ### right you'd never want to play
11637, FUNNY, ### now let me say something about the staircase which may seem like an odd metaphor for seniors given the fact that many seniors are challenged by stairs
8401, FUNNY, ### he's getting out of san quentin in a couple of weeks and he shares your fervent desire that art should engage and enable people to connect
9965, FUNNY, ### i did the thing and was very surprised to discover that i am fat and bald

11671, FUNNY, ### i'll have that surgery
11050, NOTFUNNY, ### now i had hoped to team up with some of these larger companies in order to defend against this lawsuit but one they settled out of the case even though and this is important none of these companies infringed on this patent not a one of them
647, NOTFUNNY, ### there's no real emergence there
1305, FUNNY, ### it isn't some cultic thing
8956, FUNNY, ### mission accomplished greenpeace was thrilled the whales were happy that's a quote
12426, FUNNY, ### and i was thinking about how being with these extraordinary people on this particular panel that it's beneath beyond and between and the vagina kind of fits into all those categories
6604, NOTFUNNY, ### i think it was circumstantial
9052, FUNNY, ### i survived just so you know
1002, FUNNY, ### i thought every seven went through this
3078, NOTFUNNY, ### he replied don't you know what they call it i do
11484, NOTFUNNY, ### every time your brain has a success you just changed the goalpost of what success looked like
11815, NOTFUNNY, ### you have my friend who has a on personal recorders
14616, NOTFUNNY, ### several years ago i was working at the south side walnut cafe a local diner in town and during my time there i would go through phases of militant lesbian intensity not shaving my armpits quoting difranco lyrics as gospel
2168, NOTFUNNY, ### we don't do the everything else so well
10136, NOTFUNNY, ### and the accumulated amount of man made global warming pollution that is up in the atmosphere now traps as much extra heat energy as would be released by hiroshima class atomic bombs exploding every hours days a year
15002, NOTFUNNY, ### but we know how to fix this
9260, NOTFUNNY, ### the lesson was simplicity sells
8225, FUNNY, ### it would be a big seller
8340, NOTFUNNY, ### for example no one can do two notes at the same time
2424, NOTFUNNY, ### this is the moment in which you as the architect and your client can begin to inject vision and agency
10277, FUNNY, ### it turns out the death rates on death row from all causes including execution two percent a year
4203, FUNNY, ### how many people out there are in love anyone in love out there you might be gay

15130, FUNNY, ### this is a letter from the director concerned about especially unfair on the matter of sugar
11306, FUNNY, ### to the dismay of my mother this is dangerous teenage fashion right there
10695, NOTFUNNY, ### there are in fact hundreds of definitions of trust and most can be reduced to some kind of risk assessment of how likely it is that things will go right
1379, NOTFUNNY, ### so again both animals and humans do the same thing
1445, FUNNY, ### this is mostly to be honest with you from the business sector innovation creativity and change
9055, NOTFUNNY, ### and we talked about snakes i don't know why we talked about snakes and fear of snakes as a phobia
8393, FUNNY, ### and then a delicate dance between dinner and death the is consumed by the ants they become mummified and a mushroom pops out of their head
4506, NOTFUNNY, ### full of women who were as fierce and as fit as they were and as driven to make a difference
11965, NOTFUNNY, ### there is a very common sentiment that arises in this debate even among people who are uncomfortable with mass surveillance which says that there is no real harm that comes from this large scale invasion because only people who are engaged in bad acts have a reason to want to hide and to care about their privacy
12974, NOTFUNNY, ### we didn't all know each other but we all kind of trusted each other and that basic feeling of trust permeated the whole network and there was a real sense that we could depend on each other to do things
11857, NOTFUNNY, ### but that was my first real experience as a solo singer songwriter
13025, NOTFUNNY, ### they decide to build a toilet and a shower room
1083, NOTFUNNY, ### so i said fine i've got a new plan
12490, NOTFUNNY, ### if you arouse people enough and get them stimulated enough they will laugh at very very little
13227, NOTFUNNY, ### maybe no one's really crazy
9444, FUNNY, ### we have to open a parachute just seconds before i would say impact

6769, NOTFUNNY, ### along with that what we now know as planets comets and asteroids formed
13112, FUNNY, ### and then one eight said hey why wouldn't you want to fly too and the whole room including me was like yeah
10551, FUNNY, ### so it turned out that starting a council of dads was a very efficient way to find out what my wife really thought of my friends
6263, NOTFUNNY, ### now medical devices have come a long way technologically
2809, NOTFUNNY, ### in an adult brain of course we've built up a large repertoire of mastered skills and abilities that we can perform more or less automatically from memory and that define us as acting moving thinking creatures
9285, NOTFUNNY, ### and then in the midst of all this came this new context for thinking about what it meant to be good
8954, FUNNY, ### people were putting up signs in the real world about this whale
10356, FUNNY, ### sixty eight percent of mothers with high feelings of entitlement and self esteem identified with the dancing cats in a commercial for purina
5820, FUNNY, ### and you'd come up with some sort of crazy ridiculous unforgettable image to remind you that the first thing you want to talk about is this totally bizarre contest
2083, NOTFUNNY, ### and some of the reason for that is that people take what happens to them extremely personally they own their success but they also own their failure
3156, FUNNY, ### it's sort of a visual canon
4353, FUNNY, ### can we make a toothbrush into a toy we could combine a toothbrush with a guitar and you've got a toy you can play with while brushing your teeth
10439, NOTFUNNY, ### in fact just before african scholars had collected a random assortment of old books and left them out for the terrorists to burn
14801, FUNNY, ### it's like a massage
4588, FUNNY, ### it's just in fact if i was coca cola i'd be pretty distressed about this but basically this is it
4060, FUNNY, ### you have to tone down the jesus stuff a little bit but keep the enthusiasm
5870, FUNNY, ### okay
9647, NOTFUNNY, ### but really what they're doing is they're showing what's possible with technology today
903, NOTFUNNY, ### compassion is something that creates happiness
11447, NOTFUNNY, ### so at the school of international affairs we go very heavy on the debate and rule number one is do your research so that's what i did and it surprised me how easy it was to find women in my faith who were leaders who were innovative who were strong politically economically even militarily
11244, NOTFUNNY, ### as a born gen x er hurtling all too quickly to my fortieth birthday i'm naturally inclined to pessimism
11165, FUNNY, ### because he's an open mouth sleeper he says he has to floss more to help prevent gum disease and so i asked him how often he and he said every other day
5366, NOTFUNNY, ### we now have the capacity to find common ground with people who we will never meet but who we will meet through the internet and through all the modern means of communication that we now have the capacity to organize and take collective action together to deal with the problem or an injustice that we want to deal with and i believe that this makes this a unique age in human history and it is the start of what i would call the creation of a truly global society
2632, FUNNY, ### and perhaps because of its size a group of people all by the way with y chromosomes decided they would want to sequence it
5427, FUNNY, ### those kinds of loose analogies with computers and with programming are actually much deeper than that
9288, FUNNY, ### and things got a lot more fun when the internet came around
11802, FUNNY, ### if you looked in the book you saw this
9362, FUNNY, ### the little boat in front of it was the one in which years later christopher columbus crossed the atlantic
8477, NOTFUNNY, ### at first living in the van was great
13743, NOTFUNNY, ### specifically it feels like little bits of my time get slipped away to various things like this like technology i check things
6145, NOTFUNNY, ### as our tools improve technology magnifies our leverage and increases the importance of our expertise and our judgment and our creativity
13156, FUNNY, ### sh
14428, NOTFUNNY, ### so i said to the psychiatrist get sexual pleasure from crashing cars into walls
10789, NOTFUNNY, ### so it's already too late to avoid it and it probably has been too late to avoid it ever since before anyone realized the danger
2744, FUNNY, ### it's not the most science positive state in the united states of america
14339, FUNNY, ### so he had to resign
11822, NOTFUNNY, ### it's this record of who you are your persona
10024, FUNNY, ### open ended open hearth open source open door policy open bar
5984, FUNNY, ### the is frogs at home don't pay attention to that
13480, FUNNY, ### this is what the internet looked like when it was born and you can call that the internet of middle aged white men mostly middle aged white men
78, FUNNY, ### let me show you this is a depiction of how the creative process works for most of us
2309, FUNNY, ### imagine if your beliefs guarantee you can never get to where you want to go
4616, NOTFUNNY, ### but let me start with a viking photograph
7295, FUNNY, ### and it's got a little bit of an emotional response here
12384, NOTFUNNY, ### i can't see
8330, FUNNY, ### and so later i got married and like all good egyptians started my career as an engineer
3862, FUNNY, ### and everybody's happy about that
1351, NOTFUNNY, ### we faced many challenges
14080, NOTFUNNY, ### with a giant battery we'd be able to address the problem of that prevents wind and solar from contributing to the grid in the same way that coal gas and nuclear do today
12731, NOTFUNNY, ### and then we discovered these things gold and oil and fishing and timber and it became you know a trillion dollar economy and now we take our honeymoons there
1229, NOTFUNNY, ### this is about vision
10246, FUNNY, ### hey we live in a very noxious world
4163, NOTFUNNY, ### so the same guardian are video games art the debate that shouldn't be
10618, NOTFUNNY, ### is more about how do you respond to stimulation including social stimulation
4711, FUNNY, ### and i think it's fair to say already that there are people in this audience at this moment displaying psychological symptoms i would like to discuss today
5906, NOTFUNNY, ### now comedy travels along a distinct wavelength from other forms of language
1634, NOTFUNNY, ### we need those face interactions where we learn the choreography of altruism and where we create those spiritual goods like friendship and trust and loyalty and love that redeem our solitude
4512, FUNNY, ### i hope i have achieved that
14099, FUNNY, ### ten percent of the time people's minds are wandering when they're having sex
11231, NOTFUNNY, ### alt facts have that quality
12207, NOTFUNNY, ### his formidably equipped army won batter after battle and within years his tiny kingdom had succeeded in conquering all its larger richer more powerful neighbors to found the mighty chinese empire
9730, NOTFUNNY, ### in i traveled to three war zones
1703, NOTFUNNY, ### on a crowded bus there was always a lap to sit on
13483, NOTFUNNY, ### so i learned to follow hunches even though you can't necessarily justify them or know where they're going to go
5886, FUNNY, ### and in fact i am sitting on this stage looking like i do in this wheelchair and you are probably kind of expecting me to inspire you
9670, FUNNY, ### they're not very well designed
14701, NOTFUNNY, ### you are being watched
14172, FUNNY, ### so again we got the short end of the deal there
11654, FUNNY, ### now if you ever made a essentially the same thing
15318, NOTFUNNY, ### now you don't need me to give you too many examples of people synthesizing happiness i suspect
11842, FUNNY, ### when you start talking like donald duck there's no situation in the world that can seem tense
10387, NOTFUNNY, ### so i was fortunate enough to be born a very dreamy child
6180, FUNNY, ### there are dynamics in the opinion and advocacy markets no one ever attracted observers advocates and donors by saying things just seem to be getting better and better
11751, NOTFUNNY, ### so give me five years
564, NOTFUNNY, ### and this is battista
2481, FUNNY, ### if people are spying on us it stands to reason that they have to listen to what we are saying
4293, FUNNY, ### and meetings are just toxic terrible poisonous things during the day at work
817, NOTFUNNY, ### i put it on and tried to play
12681, NOTFUNNY, ### oh my god
1772, FUNNY, ### listen if that's good feminism i am a very bad feminist
6352, NOTFUNNY, ### and they found that the average engaged in about tasks in a week
1623, FUNNY, ### on the team they get significantly better
12980, FUNNY, ### and i came to the conclusion that we had built an incredible quality of life if you happen to be a car
1181, FUNNY, ### without you i'm just a guy talking to an empty room and i spent a lot of time last week doing that and it's not the same as this
7488, NOTFUNNY, ### ok
10564, FUNNY, ### no one wears trousers with a quite that high in this day and age
6754, FUNNY, ### and i'm very glad to say i don't think i have many friends who are competent and reliable but extremely dishonest
5004, FUNNY, ### i feel like i'm diagonally parked in a parallel universe
3371, FUNNY, ### and that's what he did
6445, FUNNY, ### but this is not a self aggrandizing enterprise because in this type of discovery research if you don't feel like a complete idiot most of the time you're just not hard enough
14251, FUNNY, ### and whatever you do don't read anything about genetics that's published within your lifetime or something
572, FUNNY, ### and i would bring people to the lab and i would put their finger in it and i would crunch it a little bit
2887, NOTFUNNY, ### so the triptych
10151, NOTFUNNY, ### groucho marx charlie you should have come to the first party
14574, NOTFUNNY, ### they're cell oriented
9016, FUNNY, ### and perhaps the clearest example of this is stoning adulterers
4318, FUNNY, ### and here's the best part have sneaker portfolios
13416, FUNNY, ### you see after three years of my four in that district three years in after putting pastors in the car with my police because i knew this it's a little secret i knew this it was hard to stay a nasty police officer while you're riding around with a clergy
3230, NOTFUNNY, ### and the is where alzheimer's happens
6171, FUNNY, ### this little snake was kind of a bit for it what we'd call a or a donut or something like that
14382, FUNNY, ### because you don't want to get an unfortunate juxtaposition where you're talking about one thing instead of the other
8831, FUNNY, ### ooh
15031, FUNNY, ### there are some web pages like this you know but they take some nourishment down from the databases but people put prices on them stupid passwords and boring statistics
3977, FUNNY, ### this is a well known phenomenon
9893, NOTFUNNY, ### i told myself it was because i was growing up and maturing not that i was suddenly looking for acceptance
12377, NOTFUNNY, ### and consequently we can see the result all around us
10114, NOTFUNNY, ### actually it turns out that your risk of breast cancer increases slightly with every amount of alcohol you drink
5710, NOTFUNNY, ### it just tells you they were both designed to fit the human hand
7635, NOTFUNNY, ### but as tools have become more and more complex we need more complex controls to control them
2122, NOTFUNNY, ### so broken bled the blues and we tried to empty ourselves so we'd feel nothing
1190, NOTFUNNY, ### the first job that he ever got in the safari business was fixing the safari trucks
2810, NOTFUNNY, ### the first great epoch is commonly called the critical period
847, NOTFUNNY, ### but if you understood how important meaning is then you would figure out that it's actually important to spend some time energy and effort in getting people to care more about what they're doing
5439, NOTFUNNY, ### the permanent ice is marked in red
3876, NOTFUNNY, ### that was interesting
11258, FUNNY, ### this what you just gave us is not the classic tour that people get today when they go to the sistine chapel
14762, FUNNY, ### it's a bit odd
7642, FUNNY, ### i actually think that being a girl is so powerful that we've had to train everyone not to be that
336, FUNNY, ### and with the wisdom of my stanford degree i said pierre what a stupid idea
11319, FUNNY, ### and as the saying goes when angry you will make the best speech you will ever regret
11989, FUNNY, ### and i watched so many existential crises unfold in front of me
11402, FUNNY, ### right so effectively we ended up with a database of everything brad pitt's face is capable of doing
5983, NOTFUNNY, ### then on september that tattooed man enters the mart
8936, NOTFUNNY, ### we found pastor bob and offered to give the response some infrastructure
9301, FUNNY, ### this is just like a residency program for those of you that are in medical school
7005, NOTFUNNY, ### my eyes clenched tighter so i wouldn't see the wheat being separated from the chaff
5626, FUNNY, ### i want to give the name middle world to the medium scaled environment in which we've evolved the ability to take act nothing to do with middle earth middle world
6609, NOTFUNNY, ### i mean charlie moore did a bunch of it but it didn't feel good to me
5944, FUNNY, ### we must have some way of continuing to work even if computers fail
6912, FUNNY, ### so i said ok this proves my theory about learned paralysis and the critical role of visual input but i'm not going to get a nobel prize for getting somebody to move his phantom limb
15332, NOTFUNNY, ### as a result i come to believe that in reality there's a red tomato a meter away
6740, FUNNY, ### say my bad
10937, FUNNY, ### after watching eight he wants to become leonardo da vinci
9451, NOTFUNNY, ### so for i'm training hard for my two new projects
6216, FUNNY, ### and so that's a masterpiece which is a fake of a masterpiece and bonded into the canvas is a chip which identifies that as a real fake if you see what i mean
384, FUNNY, ### because national geographic is a magazine they remind us all the time they publish pictures not excuses
341, NOTFUNNY, ### and what really drives me is a vision of the future that i think we all share
10926, FUNNY, ### and i said i don't know actually
3538, FUNNY, ### i'm jewish but i'm jewish in the same way the olive garden is italian
1065, FUNNY, ### i'm going to shove it into my bag i'm going to have this email template and i'm going to fill it out and collect information on all these different data points during the date to prove to everybody that empirically these dates really are terrible
7001, FUNNY, ### it struck me that it would have been strange anyway for jesus to come back again and again based on the different time zones
15010, FUNNY, ### i hate to admit it but this wasn't even close to my worst landing
248, NOTFUNNY, ### when i first met deep blue in in february i had been the world champion for more than years and i had played world championship games and hundreds of games against other top players in other competitions
461, NOTFUNNY, ### nothing doesn't exist because there is always something

11250, FUNNY, ### it is a pound creature who is in rut
13768, FUNNY, ### of course there are the bases which refer to specific sexual activities that happen in a very specific order ultimately resulting in scoring a run or hitting a home run which is usually having vaginal intercourse to the point of orgasm at least for the guy
9281, NOTFUNNY, ### and so i this code to train a system on one person in our culture who would never need to be in that manner which is spears
13632, FUNNY, ### the bad news was that to do it he had to drive at miles an hour constant speed and got pulled over by the cops
5344, FUNNY, ### japan is doing crazy things with toilets
14861, NOTFUNNY, ### a male coworker was annoyed that i had been out on so he intentionally opened the door on me while i was pumping breast milk and stood in the doorway with inmates in the hallway
11499, FUNNY, ### i think that's the cia asking what the code is for a ted membership
14959, NOTFUNNY, ### we need to redefine leadership as being about lollipop moments how many of them we create how many we acknowledge how many of them we pay forward and how many we say thank you for
8186, FUNNY, ### i surprised myself as you may see in that photo
6304, FUNNY, ### don't bring your measuring stick
14149, NOTFUNNY, ### but i decided then to just give it a try
12571, FUNNY, ### i sometimes think i'd rather give up meat or sex or wine than the chance to check on my emails
11821, NOTFUNNY, ### that's not a huge amount of people reading but people matter
4773, FUNNY, ### sorry
3609, FUNNY, ### very funny
9935, NOTFUNNY, ### as they turn toward us you'll see that the pelvic area of early is a little flatter and doesn't have to rotate quite so much from side to side
3234, FUNNY, ### there was so many skeptics especially the press in london that they started flying cheeseburgers on helicopters around my box to tempt me
12021, FUNNY, ### if we die out the insects will continue very happily
3971, NOTFUNNY, ### first you can read some other family histories get a sense for the style
11269, FUNNY, ### they're not very animated
12311, FUNNY, ### and the talk you heard about ethanol earlier today to me is the final triumph of corn over good sense
1487, FUNNY, ### even though at least a third of them deep in their hearts actually did
5858, FUNNY, ### perhaps detecting my concern he leaned forward and said as reassuringly as he could ah don't worry about the buzzer it doesn't work anyway
6187, FUNNY, ### so the truth is if you look at the temperature over here dung is cool
5370, FUNNY, ### and i would stand at attention and all the girls would crack up and it was sort of a little joke
13247, NOTFUNNY, ### some days i put the people in their places at the table bend their legs at the knees if they come with that feature and fix them into the tiny wooden chairs
11018, FUNNY, ### and now we use johnson's no more tears which we probably should've been using right from the very beginning
4045, FUNNY, ### and to realize that people across the world are genuinely invested in the status of your new relationship
15401, FUNNY, ### lots of laughter quite a bit of embarrassment

14260, FUNNY, ### when you buy a pie the whole family has to agree and apple is everyone's second favorite
1208, NOTFUNNY, ### but they kept at it and i now understand why they did what they did
2374, NOTFUNNY, ### they contain a lot of information
12328, FUNNY, ### he said i'll give you a rope to hang yourself

2035, FUNNY, ### we didn't wait any prerequisite amount of time for our courtship we told each other the vulnerable truths up front i am a man which means the f on my birth certificate should have stood for false instead of female
8910, FUNNY, ### and we feel like some of that difficulty was because of this false advertisement around parenting

15169, FUNNY, ### well the third and final wish is somewhat unfortunately it's much more complicated because it involves lawyers
14646, NOTFUNNY, ### so a little bit of perspective about years of perspective
9176, NOTFUNNY, ### what it means in terms of the distances between them how they will start to feel separate from each other and just the logistics of the time
2932, NOTFUNNY, ### brilliant elegant

2391, NOTFUNNY, ### in canada we're now looking at one in canadian children with asthma

9926, FUNNY, ### he's learning the uses for a fire just by watching what we do with fire
189, NOTFUNNY, ### truffles are this delicacy that stems from a fungus growing on the roots of living trees
1449, NOTFUNNY, ### and that myth is profoundly dangerous
13626, NOTFUNNY, ### so when men share housework and childcare their children are happier and healthier and men want this
9916, FUNNY, ### i actually had to hack it and that's a thing which we can talk about in another speech
4223, NOTFUNNY, ### but as we straddle the top of this energy mountain at this stage we move from a time where our economic success our sense of individual prowess and well being is directly linked to how much of this we consume to a time when actually our degree of oil dependency is our degree of vulnerability
11863, NOTFUNNY, ### of course in the challenge there is a prize
7461, FUNNY, ### so all right we'll leave them like that
5672, NOTFUNNY, ### and so i decided to put him in a depression
8338, FUNNY, ### as you can probably well imagine i was a strange child

8215, NOTFUNNY, ### i want to talk to you now about different ways of thinking
4224, FUNNY, ### but i think to set the scene i want to show the next slide is not my attempt to show the worst ted slide in the history of ted but it is a bit of a mess

9179, FUNNY, ### and you can tell it is a starck design by its precision its playfulness its innovation and its promise of imminent violence

416, FUNNY, ### this is your life enjoy it
14476, NOTFUNNY, ### this copy would remember everything the same and if it starts out with the same speed looking at the same speed it might even need to be told you are the copy

359, NOTFUNNY, ### i graduated from university to become a theater director and that progress is entirely to do with the fact that people i'll never meet fought for women to have rights get the vote get education have progress
11230, FUNNY, ### so with the anonymity of the internet i went undercover
6076, NOTFUNNY, ### what it proved is this that death valley isn't dead
9930, FUNNY, ### kanzi and are stimulated by this fun filled environment which promotes the emergence of these cultural capabilities
4880, FUNNY, ### right so next subject is a young woman next subject class is a young woman called bella a university student interviewed in during what was called an intro to feminist porn class as part of her major in sex work at a college in the bay area
5166, FUNNY, ### here in biosphere well it takes me about two minutes because i pick up the phone and i call and say hey can you deliver the pizza so biosphere was essentially a three acre entirely sealed miniature world that i lived in for two years and minutes
12400, FUNNY, ### relations through top down policy changes and judicial system reforms
12439, NOTFUNNY, ### there has been no response to the disappearance and not one person has been held accountable
1752, FUNNY, ### it must have been a very unusual day for him
9829, FUNNY, ### you can think of this nagging inner voice as sort of the brain's equivalent of the catholic church if you're an austrian like me or the super ego if you're freudian or your mother if you're jewish
168, NOTFUNNY, ### where do you get your ideas in the lunchroom
7651, FUNNY, ### i think it's been a weird years
14905, FUNNY, ### and i said fu as in i finally understand
89, NOTFUNNY, ### what about martin luther king jr
943, NOTFUNNY, ### we looked at in new mexico
10158, FUNNY, ### last year we did a dance in zero gravity and once we set up an obstacle course out of thousands of musical instruments in the desert and then played them by stunt driving a car through them
6763, NOTFUNNY, ### think about this here were girls who braved danger to become breadwinners during years in which they couldn't even be on their streets
10470, FUNNY, ### so we were happy
6419, NOTFUNNY, ### the magician looked at me and said this is a disaster
4501, FUNNY, ### they would put pounds of weight on their backs and board the helicopter for an operation and they would come back and watch a movie called bridesmaids
12805, NOTFUNNY, ### but i'll try to convince you that spectroscopy is actually something which can change this world
1358, FUNNY, ### and he could have written quite an essay on what i did over my summer vacation
9945, NOTFUNNY, ### they basically pulled themselves up by the bootstraps
3515, FUNNY, ### it also led them to read shorter books
3354, FUNNY, ### one brooklyn paper called this bike lane that we have on prospect park west the most contested piece of land outside of the gaza strip
5387, FUNNY, ### you could be the president of the united states or the inventor of the next internet or a ninja surgeon poet which would be awesome because you'd be the first one
9671, FUNNY, ### today i'm going to show you four because i hope to have a competitive advantage at the end of this still
15344, NOTFUNNY, ### we all feel younger than our real age because the spirit never ages
1223, FUNNY, ### actually i hear a lot my husband is tone deaf
9254, NOTFUNNY, ### software is subject to another primal force the mandate to release more and more versions
8712, FUNNY, ### or somebody made a chair that when somebody
3717, FUNNY, ### this is the making its first outing in a demo
14268, NOTFUNNY, ### i've been fascinated by how nature makes materials and there's a lot of secrets to how they do such an exquisite job
9461, FUNNY, ### that means to fall in love in international sign
2389, FUNNY, ### now my wife tells me and i'm sure penelope can as well that there's nothing more painful than childbirth which that i'll never experience i can't really argue that but i would guess that a dozen chicken eggs in my testicle would probably be somewhere in the top five
12733, NOTFUNNY, ### my plan is to actually buy puts on the precious metal market and then actually claim that i'm going to go out and get one
1365, NOTFUNNY, ### and he said here it is the business of natural philosophy to find out those laws
14864, FUNNY, ### and they were the first to
14527, NOTFUNNY, ### and i have some good news if you're looking to avoid the whole doomed to decay and die thing you will have all the help in the world in that avoidance from the funeral industry
1378, NOTFUNNY, ### so the arms up in the v the chin is slightly lifted
9977, NOTFUNNY, ### you weren't just learning to dance you were learning to man and to woman
9815, FUNNY, ### now this was a mystery in the new york times where the honey was very red and the new york state forensics department came in and they actually did some science to match the red dye with that found in a maraschino cherry factory down the street
10321, NOTFUNNY, ### i created my dream job hosting a public radio show
8314, NOTFUNNY, ### it's actually part of an ongoing art project
8710, FUNNY, ### this is called because there's an ball with a fi module in the plant and it's measuring the well being of the plant and it's creating a account where you can actually interact with the plant
1574, FUNNY, ### this is clearly following my wife's values which is happy wife happy life
9710, FUNNY, ### you got to question everything that is told to you including what i just told you today
14310, FUNNY, ### i'm really cute
11736, FUNNY, ### that'll calm her down
7646, NOTFUNNY, ### and i want to call it the girl cell
2044, NOTFUNNY, ### i love him whole pre transition now and in the future
8505, FUNNY, ### i used a stamp to defend canada's borders
5337, FUNNY, ### i was really happy when i was done
5656, FUNNY, ### we finally settled on a shape that was the proportion of the with the sloping outside walls which the said were crucial to this and later decided they weren't but now we have them
7652, FUNNY, ### and he just sobered up immediately and he stuck out his hand put a hand on my shoulder and in a real earnest very nice voice he was like i hope you make it someday
5124, NOTFUNNY, ### social structure adapts to accommodate this possibility and to harness this productive potential so you get cities you know and you get all the non games you don't think about that are being played across the world
15460, NOTFUNNY, ### and we have been to saturn before we visited saturn in the early but our investigations of saturn have become far more in depth in detail since the cassini spacecraft traveling across interplanetary space for seven years glided into orbit around saturn in the summer of and became at that point the farthest robotic outpost that humanity had ever established around the sun
7047, NOTFUNNY, ### so you're now about billion years into this
12039, FUNNY, ### but now we want our partner to still give us all these things but in addition i want you to be my best friend and my trusted confidant and my passionate lover to boot and we live twice as long
6463, NOTFUNNY, ### on the third day it was gone
1327, FUNNY, ### now i'm guessing that this sounds terrifying
11387, FUNNY, ### so these are three pound charges of c4 that's about times what the guy had in his shoes
2050, FUNNY, ### that was it
9564, NOTFUNNY, ### actually they live in the garbage
10191, FUNNY, ### it didn't go down that well with some people
5781, FUNNY, ### but why pan african the scramble for africa during the berlin conference of where quite frankly we africans were not exactly consulted resulted in massive fragmentation and many sovereign states with small populations liberia four million cape verde
978, NOTFUNNY, ### they have to obey four simple laws
8181, NOTFUNNY, ### then this is a fairly talkative kind of chair
11354, NOTFUNNY, ### the technique of war has been developed over thousands of years with massive resources and some of our best minds dedicated to understanding and improving how it works
3428, NOTFUNNY, ### participants who felt rich took two times as much candy as participants who felt poor
4170, FUNNY, ### the answer's easy my husband greg
11582, FUNNY, ### and this tribal psychology is so deeply pleasurable that even when we don't have tribes we go ahead and make them because it's fun
7663, FUNNY, ### at least not yet
6075, NOTFUNNY, ### death valley is the hottest driest place in america and nothing grows there
15446, NOTFUNNY, ### and it's had a magical effect on me on my children on our family
3491, FUNNY, ### that was much better
9465, NOTFUNNY, ### yet i realize now that that wasn't the case at all
15096, NOTFUNNY, ### it doesn't care about the consequences because it can't because it's just information being copied
3984, FUNNY, ### here's a time lapse of one of the time lapse units being made
15494, FUNNY, ### modernism means white box and it's a perfect white box
13370, FUNNY, ### it might be the evolutionary origin of the phrase she's got him by the balls
14786, NOTFUNNY, ### you can see my wife struggling to stack a brick of postcards on a pyramid of over a half million secrets
9066, FUNNY, ### but i've also over the last year or so got in touch with my inner tortoise
2422, NOTFUNNY, ### now something else happened
7825, FUNNY, ### well these are my pretty legs
12044, FUNNY, ### if everybody was fantasizing on a bed of roses we wouldn't be having such interesting talks about this
11759, FUNNY, ### but my parents i think part of why they kind of are able to appreciate it is because they don't understand it
7928, NOTFUNNY, ### you all know what the likelihood is of pulling the ace of spades or of flipping a heads
11635, FUNNY, ### some of the studies even say we're happier
8020, FUNNY, ### tyler dewar the way i feel right now is that all of the other speakers have said exactly what i wanted to say
4187, NOTFUNNY, ### but we have a challenge
12306, FUNNY, ### i have a two daughter named who is under the mistaken impression that this conference is named in honor of her father
5308, FUNNY, ### and if we have these predictable repeatable mistakes in vision which we're so good at what are the chances we won't make even more mistakes in something we're not as good at for example financial decision making
1062, FUNNY, ### so i just copied and pasted from my
14300, NOTFUNNY, ### when become interested in something we go hard
1705, FUNNY, ### but i'm more like scotty in star trek
11810, FUNNY, ### because the joke in this is that this person is not a tyrant this person is so loving and so sweet that he lets me dress him up and post pictures of him to my
8213, FUNNY, ### you know you once wrote i like this quote if by some magic autism had been eradicated from the face of the earth then men would still be socializing in front of a wood fire at the entrance to a cave
8205, NOTFUNNY, ### and we're not like that
8190, FUNNY, ### but like all of us he had some problems
12478, NOTFUNNY, ### that actually is the true nature of the distribution of humor when you don't have the contagion of humor
7606, FUNNY, ### and so this guy gets the snail all set up and gives it a good whack
11379, FUNNY, ### so that when louis leakey my mentor heard this news he said ah we must now redefine redefine or accept chimpanzees as humans
14212, FUNNY, ### relax on where your shadow always has company
687, NOTFUNNY, ### social includes human capital things like employee engagement and innovation capacity as well as supply chain management and labor rights and human rights
30, FUNNY, ### and the photos kept traveling even without us
15195, FUNNY, ### well i happened to have been very quick that day and i said yeah but a lot less baloney
2919, FUNNY, ### but let's say for a moment that you were
12607, FUNNY, ### you know robots are even revolutionizing cat transportation
12407, NOTFUNNY, ### that's visible to our eye but it's the equivalent of infrared in the deep sea
7941, FUNNY, ### whereas my wife she calls me the star of her life
13920, NOTFUNNY, ### but i think this is a mistake for two main reasons
5161, FUNNY, ### all they do is make me feel bad
6367, FUNNY, ### between men and women
7442, NOTFUNNY, ### it didn't come from there
15243, NOTFUNNY, ### actually it has exactly the same problem which existed in all the neighborhoods where you grew up as well
13015, NOTFUNNY, ### yeah
8337, NOTFUNNY, ### and i found that because there weren't video games and this saturation of movies and all of this imagery in the media landscape i had to create these images in my head
6253, NOTFUNNY, ### i think he's going to be super popular
2284, FUNNY, ### so i became very methodical about testing different ways that i could manage my ups and downs which has proven to be a good investment
10078, FUNNY, ### well yes you can if you move their food
13154, FUNNY, ### just bring it down a little
4027, FUNNY, ### i'm going to show grandma to you
2512, NOTFUNNY, ### i started to worry about the fact that a lot of people don't get their portraits painted anymore and they're amazing people and we want to deliver them to future generations
4867, FUNNY, ### and i couldn't really face that so i started to challenge the conventions of the time even to the extent of changing my name from stephanie to steve in my business development letters so as to get through the door before anyone realized that he was a she
11696, FUNNY, ### and we probably need well we probably need a cowboy to be quite honest
14441, NOTFUNNY, ### what has changed our society has been wireless devices
2672, NOTFUNNY, ### witness please eugene shoemaker who diligently from a young boy decided he wanted to make maps of celestial bodies
11955, FUNNY, ### and once you make it there the big question is where to start
4471, NOTFUNNY, ### we're looking at a lot of compounds but recently been quite interested in the flame the flame that are in many many things that we use in our everyday life from the cushions in the chairs we're all sitting on to the plastic casings of our computers our television sets and so on
3467, NOTFUNNY, ### we haven't reached that other shore and still our sense of pride and commitment unwavering commitment
12051, NOTFUNNY, ### i look at this person by the way in desire people rarely talk about it when we are blended into one five centimeters from each other
7473, NOTFUNNY, ### ok but don't say my name like that
14351, NOTFUNNY, ### i hope you'll think it's a good example of harmony
2202, FUNNY, ### and if it's someone else's problem you probably don't have the answer anyway
12703, FUNNY, ### this is unlike the rest of the developed world where as george burns quipped happiness is having a large loving caring family in another city
334, FUNNY, ### hollywood has its sex symbols and the valley has its sex symbols
8894, NOTFUNNY, ### so we would love to explore europa to go down through the ice find out who is swimming around in the ocean whether there are fish or seaweed or sea monsters whatever there may be that's exciting or
1422, NOTFUNNY, ### they did it by draining the land
12532, FUNNY, ### tell a woman
14812, NOTFUNNY, ### and that's what i want to talk about today
14703, NOTFUNNY, ### but in conjuring his life it was okay and very straightforward to portray a caribbean life in england in the with bowls of plastic fruit polystyrene ceiling tiles permanently sheathed in their transparent covers that they were delivered in
1087, NOTFUNNY, ### well one month later i had a lot of data and i was able to do another analysis
4490, FUNNY, ### i keep that for evidence
10902, FUNNY, ### now i could look at my hand for two weeks and i wouldn't feel any awe or wonder because i can't compose
4592, NOTFUNNY, ### and in we were the only nuclear power
9359, NOTFUNNY, ### we saw a weird looking alien bump on a distant mountain but once we got closer we saw it was a rock
12806, NOTFUNNY, ### but you have it in planets and asteroids
10447, NOTFUNNY, ### i'm going to start by sharing with you a story about a good friend of mine
4996, FUNNY, ### you can play a game and try and think of one i've missed at or try and boil it down to just four but you'll lose
3026, FUNNY, ### and when i reflected on my own career and the extraordinary people i've had the privilege to work with i realized how much more we could give each other if we just stopped trying to be
10427, FUNNY, ### by the way you reacted i can see your lack of interest
13695, FUNNY, ### that's all over his page and it's gone viral
11031, FUNNY, ### should've been a dancer
14792, FUNNY, ### and finally let's see this is a totally different interaction and i think you have to imagine that there's this giant invisible drum sitting right here on stage and i'm going to bang it
12068, NOTFUNNY, ### fourteen percent loneliness causes high blood pressure high cholesterol
11782, FUNNY, ### i had just gone through a breakup
11640, NOTFUNNY, ### this upward ascension can happen even in the face of extreme physical challenges
7647, NOTFUNNY, ### and then let's think how compassion informs wisdom and that vulnerability is our greatest strength and that emotions have inherent logic which lead to radical appropriate saving action
235, FUNNY, ### here's a from the civil war
188, NOTFUNNY, ### well several companies around the world are working on making this same technology accessible to everyday people like the pig farmer like you
8311, FUNNY, ### so for the last years i've been taking pads of this paper tons of this stuff and smuggling it into the stationery supplies of the united states and the coalition governments
8558, FUNNY, ### very happy and i was happy to be alive of course
12979, FUNNY, ### i thought what a stupid website
3406, NOTFUNNY, ### so it went on like that and i didn't know where else to find myself
14987, FUNNY, ### that's fine says george i'll take the soup
7668, NOTFUNNY, ### gender matters everywhere in the world but i want to focus on nigeria and on africa in general because it is where i know and because it is where my heart is
14233, FUNNY, ### walk up to it and smack it on the backside
13928, FUNNY, ### okay i wrote that
11515, FUNNY, ### big miscommunication
13198, FUNNY, ### and i asked people to send me beautiful things made out of the
7788, NOTFUNNY, ### now these animals are different from one another because they have different genes
2379, NOTFUNNY, ### i'm not sure i was the bad guy in the sense of having evil intent but it was very hard for me to get away with that story
15535, NOTFUNNY, ### it's a lot harder than you might think
11913, FUNNY, ### white once wrote of commas in the new yorker they fall with the precision of knives outlining a body
2780, FUNNY, ### instead what they did was they took people one at a time into dingy little rooms and had them talk for an hour about bad things that had happened to them
11071, FUNNY, ### in fact they funded it for that very reason
10472, FUNNY, ### it was really you know sort of a time
12803, FUNNY, ### so for me degrees is pretty cool
15330, NOTFUNNY, ### now huxley knew that brain activity and conscious experiences are correlated but he didn't know why
10052, FUNNY, ### the explosion had been caused by a water heater so nobody was hurt and ultimately it was not a big deal but later skip came up to me and said nice job caroline in this surprised sort of voice
3278, NOTFUNNY, ### every time i sort of pushed one down another one would pop back up again
10861, FUNNY, ### how all right now when people ask this kind of question they neglect something which is that physicists are really clever unlike biologists
1267, NOTFUNNY, ### part of the challenge was to try to understand rhythm and space using not just my hands because a lot of juggling is hand oriented but using the rhythm of my body and feet and controlling the balls with my feet
7512, NOTFUNNY, ### and i don't mean just set down your cell phone or your tablet or your car keys or whatever is in your hand
15432, NOTFUNNY, ### sebastian and i have forgotten some of that
207, NOTFUNNY, ### i call it sort of shotgun flexibility turn your head this way shoot and you're bound to kill something
873, NOTFUNNY, ### this is one of the most robust findings in social science and also one of the most ignored
8787, FUNNY, ### as a kid i knew them as calamari mostly
5782, NOTFUNNY, ### consider these two alternative scenarios
3284, FUNNY, ### contrary to the way we sometimes talk about it was not handed down from god on tablets of stone
2478, NOTFUNNY, ### she understands everything but the communication is just very difficult because when you look at the picture the part of your brain where those communication centers are are on the left side of your head which is where the bullet passed through
9265, NOTFUNNY, ### they just said we'll make this software work right
13801, FUNNY, ### that's one of those new chocolate cell phones
665, FUNNY, ### and this is the part it's the part i just love
6651, FUNNY, ### they're your eyes
8233, NOTFUNNY, ### and the giant in the field is in the room tonight and is speaking tomorrow morning antonio
11505, NOTFUNNY, ### so i went there in and we managed to get hold of this just prior to the election the national election december
5751, NOTFUNNY, ### now i have carefully cropped this sequence to be exactly the duration of a human eye blink so in the time that it would take you to blink your eye the fly has seen this looming predator estimated its position initiated a motor pattern to fly it away beating its wings at times a second as it does so
3801, FUNNY, ### i am a bit more primitive like a beta version of translate
5485, FUNNY, ### if you're not sure that's a predator it's too late
3319, FUNNY, ### i have some stories that are humorous like dead beats
4327, NOTFUNNY, ### someone is making the rules
11648, NOTFUNNY, ### this happens to be a slide of some analysis that we were doing about the power of risc microprocessors versus the power of local area networks
5999, NOTFUNNY, ### so sitting there with other people in the class i got to daydream a lot
8204, NOTFUNNY, ### so i studied in the morning and worked in the afternoon
10481, NOTFUNNY, ### i mean in those days it was the domain of the physicists
10607, FUNNY, ### i had a vision of girls sitting in a cabin reading books in their matching
6373, NOTFUNNY, ### the more people who know about this technology the more we can all have a voice in how it's being used
11568, NOTFUNNY, ### we used it in the century to build art museums
9856, NOTFUNNY, ### now pride of place in this practice is given to compassion
6717, NOTFUNNY, ### it's just been industrial which means those who were producing had to have a way of raising money to pay those two and a half million dollars and later more for the telegraph and the radio transmitter and the television and eventually the mainframe
11407, NOTFUNNY, ### but that changed when i was
9584, FUNNY, ### now this this is a baby the cutest animal offspring in the animal kingdom
6534, FUNNY, ### and the laptop was running windows
7513, NOTFUNNY, ### you need to enter every conversation assuming that you have something to learn
10252, FUNNY, ### the uterus would literally fall out of the body
1781, FUNNY, ### most of the comments are not thank you
13047, NOTFUNNY, ### ok here we go ok
12729, FUNNY, ### and then i truly believe once a group is in orbit around the earth i know if they don't do it i am we're going to stockpile some fuel make a for the moon and grab some real estate
6491, NOTFUNNY, ### so we really wanted to break away from that
3384, NOTFUNNY, ### i was surprised to hear a doctor talking about architecture
2772, FUNNY, ### to which you have to say that's true but i think we should focus right now on what to have for breakfast
5450, NOTFUNNY, ### then i ran across this simple verse that said at god's to confess a poor soul knelt and bowed his head
2420, FUNNY, ### again just a couple people are required
3014, FUNNY, ### the first lesson for successful life everyone is this choose your parents very carefully
10709, FUNNY, ### they know
7108, NOTFUNNY, ### since the age of five i started to learn how to draw every single stroke for each character in the correct sequence
13274, FUNNY, ### it was very easy and you can write many books very fast about it
10349, NOTFUNNY, ### there was so much history that we would have to go through to try to explain that and that's something i try to do with them anyways
13264, FUNNY, ### it's all about the truth
3764, NOTFUNNY, ### you've heard of it
6324, FUNNY, ### that's what wired magazine spent on this
12906, FUNNY, ### i'd like all of you to pause for a moment you wretched and take stock of your miserable existence
8842, FUNNY, ### there's no reason why we shouldn't start now
5087, FUNNY, ### i have one climate crisis i don't really need the second one
7273, FUNNY, ### i'll show you
14291, FUNNY, ### maybe you've heard of us
4833, NOTFUNNY, ### and they weren't flashing in anger they were flashing in love intense love for her students
7584, NOTFUNNY, ### when my son my youngest was born there was not as far as i was aware a single out gay woman in british public life
8082, NOTFUNNY, ### many have more
10832, NOTFUNNY, ### now every crow within five kilometers is standing by a sidewalk waiting to collect its lunch
4427, NOTFUNNY, ### she played two varsity sports
4188, NOTFUNNY, ### countless invading armies have done the same throughout history
11585, FUNNY, ### some of you might recognize this as the
8909, NOTFUNNY, ### human pilots only flew it seven to eight minutes the rest of the time the ai was driving
10272, FUNNY, ### and you and i probably faced with the situation would think i guess i'm going to write my dissertation on the grateful dead i've been following them for the last three months
11885, FUNNY, ### this is the silicon valley version of don't worry your pretty little head about it
3736, FUNNY, ### no i don't do that i'm a who is someone who pretends to be a real magician
10383, FUNNY, ### so and that's a song about how everybody's miserable because you know we're from russia
5991, FUNNY, ### for halloween i went dressed up as a calculator
1765, NOTFUNNY, ### that is in fact what great tribal leaders do
14409, FUNNY, ### i didn't know which of these was true but i thought it was kind of interesting and i thought maybe i should meet a critic of psychiatry to get their view which is how i ended up having lunch with the scientologists
3798, NOTFUNNY, ### it reaches up to almost pounds on a diet of jellyfish primarily
5969, NOTFUNNY, ### politicians try to pick and use words to shape and control reality but in fact reality changes words far more than words can ever change reality
4281, NOTFUNNY, ### a lot can go wrong when we put blind faith in big data
5040, NOTFUNNY, ### now people talk about this a lot and they talk about things like flextime and mentoring and programs companies should have to train women
7658, FUNNY, ### he told me that people were saying that my novel was feminist and his advice to me and he was shaking his head sadly as he spoke was that i should never call myself a feminist because feminists are women who are unhappy because they cannot find husbands
2569, NOTFUNNY, ### this is even more amazing
13643, FUNNY, ### just be profound
10562, FUNNY, ### the nearest land was antarctica and the nearest people would be those manning the european space station above me
11862, FUNNY, ### do we really understand that principle of tuning the answer is yes this is slowed down and the crab just zooms across that simulated debris
9311, NOTFUNNY, ### but in that year smallpox exploded throughout india
10241, NOTFUNNY, ### they're two sides of the same coin just like innovation and imitation like risk and responsibility like and like that poor little lamb who i hope isn't quivering anymore and like my time that's gone

260, NOTFUNNY, ### these early start policies have a direct effect on how much or really how little sleep american teenagers are getting
12968, FUNNY, ### but first see what a miserable lot we are
15186, FUNNY, ### now we see the creation of a new massive class of useless people
14237, NOTFUNNY, ### i come from a region in the remote northwest part of the country
8132, NOTFUNNY, ### much of this progress comes from a method called machine learning
6326, FUNNY, ### it's years of it that's created what i call the baba factor
3755, NOTFUNNY, ### now i have two questions i would like to ask these people if i had the opportunity to do so
14551, NOTFUNNY, ### and we you know sort of introduced them to each other
4637, NOTFUNNY, ### as we made our way up towards the spectacular blue mountains west of sydney it was the perfect autumn day sunshine the smell of and a dream
4528, FUNNY, ### i got a bit of gray hair started to dress in black like a true architect
15142, NOTFUNNY, ### and it's a story that did work
4454, FUNNY, ### so there's the scientific method but what's really going on is this
1878, NOTFUNNY, ### and in fact they know how to grow some of it themselves
7529, NOTFUNNY, ### it was about shadows
153, NOTFUNNY, ### and i was spending a lot of time way too much time in front of a screen for work that would be presented on a screen and i had this great need to get my hands back on the work again
13278, NOTFUNNY, ### i prefer the word roughness to the word irregularity because irregularity to someone who had latin in my long past youth means the contrary of regularity
6430, FUNNY, ### i'm sure he thought i'd take a book or a shirt but i found an inflatable sheep
14275, FUNNY, ### his only hope for existence on this planet is as a
7935, FUNNY, ### it's another one of those categories where maybe there's not a lot of competition
12852, FUNNY, ### in mansions where everyone in my crew gets their own room but there's no wireless and in punk squats everyone on the floor in one room with no toilets but with wireless clearly making it the better option
1693, NOTFUNNY, ### i haven't got any qualifications
8378, NOTFUNNY, ### let's just do a little mathematical experiment try and find out
9638, NOTFUNNY, ### so i put the lights
15042, NOTFUNNY, ### there's a little hump here
9860, NOTFUNNY, ### my personal journey into the world of programming and technology started at the tender age of
13066, FUNNY, ### that's the part where i sold the volvo and bought the toyota
5681, NOTFUNNY, ### the second reason is we cannot keep doing animal experimentation forever and we have to embody all our data and all our knowledge into a working model
3192, FUNNY, ### or fear like this kind of a nightclub typeface
15279, NOTFUNNY, ### now this nice picture shows a thought balloon a thought bubble
13960, FUNNY, ### now you've listened to me and i know what you're thinking she has a french accent she must be pro affair
852, NOTFUNNY, ### and great insight really was to think here's a child who can't see
10276, FUNNY, ### got to know very well the guy who had the unfortunate assignment of trying to take the iowa franchise which it turned out for this black gang was not one of the more brilliant financial endeavors they undertook
6451, NOTFUNNY, ### i think it's very safe to say that we don't even know how much about life we do not know
14676, NOTFUNNY, ### we got to walk through his climate controlled server room
10844, FUNNY, ### i actually participated in a play i hope no video of that around still
9640, FUNNY, ### weighing one to billion times the mass of our own sun these galactic black holes are devouring material at a rate of upwards of times more than your average black hole
579, NOTFUNNY, ### it turns out it would have been better to start with my face which was much more painful and move toward my legs giving me a trend of improvement over time that would have been also less painful
10900, FUNNY, ### why did she say that because it was a line from our chinese parallel susan boyle a year old woman a vegetable vendor in shanghai who loves singing western opera but she didn't understand any english or french or italian so she managed to fill in the lyrics with vegetable names in chinese
2695, FUNNY, ### he was not just a scientist he had a in molecular biology
9387, NOTFUNNY, ### the people who come up with stuff that's remarkable more often than not figure out how to put design to work for them
3103, NOTFUNNY, ### so there seems to be a complete disconnect here
7374, FUNNY, ### right now on a perfect day at the equator in the middle of summer on mars temperatures can actually reach degrees but then they go down to minus at night
2030, FUNNY, ### in france where independent thinking is not necessarily promoted
9644, NOTFUNNY, ### now organized crime has been around for a very long time i hear you say and these would be wise words indeed
11312, FUNNY, ### we call it the section fiasco the section fiasco a suspicious piece of law and i'm going to say it like it is a suspicious piece of law was passed at a suspicious time to free some suspects
13968, NOTFUNNY, ### but then we have another paradox that we're dealing with these days
9212, FUNNY, ### turns out it doesn't really make good business sense to sell someone a piece of land for eternity
3308, NOTFUNNY, ### now here's a discovery we made just last week
5032, NOTFUNNY, ### patrick's day for all of you but it was the day that turned my life upside down
8382, FUNNY, ### even more weird but probably this is the most fun part for the machine
4374, FUNNY, ### i have to say this sounds awesome
5222, NOTFUNNY, ### however we know still very little about what is hidden inside the earth
3505, NOTFUNNY, ### the thing again i want you to think about is don't look at these graphics and think of that's the way it is
15082, FUNNY, ### isn't that a wonderful thought that there could be such a thing as a best idea anybody ever had do you think there could audience no
5678, NOTFUNNY, ### in this case we learned how to detail it
5028, NOTFUNNY, ### and what we're left with after removing all the apple cells is this cellulose scaffold
9442, FUNNY, ### in i jumped the eiffel tower in paris
3109, FUNNY, ### don't get me started on that
9463, FUNNY, ### good job everyone
12187, FUNNY, ### x equals y
118, FUNNY, ### like
1025, NOTFUNNY, ### thousands of people saw it and one of them was the manual sola morales who was redesigning the waterfront in porto portugal

10862, FUNNY, ### but it has a certain it has a certain ring to it which is attractive to people who read too much century german literature
1581, NOTFUNNY, ### and i think this could be as some people have described it the biggest event in human history
1266, NOTFUNNY, ### well i learned a lot about interesting things that i knew nothing about at the time but grew to know stuff about
6221, FUNNY, ### i look pretty good in a suit frankly so you can see why it would drive them into an anti capitalist frenzy
6646, FUNNY, ### superman is not only sent to earth from the heavens or krypton but he's sent in a pod much like moses was on the nile
6736, NOTFUNNY, ### i don't do special physical training
4876, FUNNY, ### right so a bit of trivia about that era for you
2726, FUNNY, ### of course
4928, FUNNY, ### at often the goat time install a error is vomit
6366, FUNNY, ### try to remember what it was like when left one direction
13559, NOTFUNNY, ### i think we save five of clubs
2144, FUNNY, ### it will cost you billion dollars
5219, NOTFUNNY, ### in the century it was slavery
802, FUNNY, ### plus you get strawberries

10754, FUNNY, ### take a tune sing high when they sing low sing fast when they sing slow and you've got a new tune
11489, FUNNY, ### i don't think so
10011, FUNNY, ### then just staying above the earth for one more second people are acting like idiots all across the country
5818, FUNNY, ### he used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of random binary digits in half an hour
15288, NOTFUNNY, ### he didn't mention the speed
239, NOTFUNNY, ### so you're applying a force on a drill towards the wall
9404, FUNNY, ### you can email back in a couple of weeks or you can email someone else
13832, NOTFUNNY, ### he doesn't need any preexisting materials to fashion a world out of

3179, NOTFUNNY, ### do it as long as necessary until you have mastery
14702, NOTFUNNY, ### if you have seen some of the images of the caribbean people arriving in the and you might have noticed that a lot of the men wear
14795, NOTFUNNY, ### by the way i'm just going to nerd out for just a few minutes here so i would say don't freak out
8642, NOTFUNNY, ### and so we've been very lucky to have a chance to work
7309, NOTFUNNY, ### and we've been trying to put that into our lab robots because we think this is how you're going to want to interact with robots in the future
10561, NOTFUNNY, ### this one entered her left hemisphere and knocked out her area the speech center of her brain
13806, NOTFUNNY, ### if i have of these of those it makes no difference what these and those are
1612, NOTFUNNY, ### and incidentally that means that people don't like us
15205, NOTFUNNY, ### but the man had somehow a lot of room at the bottom
9606, NOTFUNNY, ### again we just take these lines and replace them with the whole shape
3114, NOTFUNNY, ### sometimes it works
2012, FUNNY, ### i am the dog you put to sleep as you like to call the needle of oblivion come back to tell you this simple thing i never liked you
11964, FUNNY, ### do you consider it possible there is that part of snowden we've not seen yet no i consider that absurd and idiotic

10968, FUNNY, ### okay
2984, FUNNY, ### for me today on this date it's like a second bar mitzvah experience
15306, FUNNY, ### first accrue wealth power and prestige then lose it
13545, FUNNY, ### you just got to this is a request from the lady in the back
6856, NOTFUNNY, ### the incident of shark engagements on humans is escalating worldwide
14712, FUNNY, ### the problem with that is no one seems to know what those two letters stand for
13401, FUNNY, ### so you can kind of see how misleading averages can be
2393, NOTFUNNY, ### what's interesting is in fact the same company that sold us million pounds of the breast cancer promoter now sells us the blocker the exact same company
1844, FUNNY, ### natalia had found a giant arctic camel
9996, FUNNY, ### it's the best return on investment they ever received
3793, NOTFUNNY, ### the instruction was simple enough but i was missing something really important
10115, NOTFUNNY, ### i'm going to tell you about one trial which is probably the most well reported trial in the news media over the past decade
2849, FUNNY, ### it's the only place you ever go for a walk in the woods and all the trees are lined up in rows
1931, FUNNY, ### and we're a pretty small staff which is me
3195, FUNNY, ### it's not clear
2602, FUNNY, ### it's not because they like horses so much it's because they try to avoid having unlucky goat babies
12902, FUNNY, ### but there was a really interesting regulation which was they had to put a backseat light install it in every jitney to stop a new pernicious innovation which they called
6615, NOTFUNNY, ### lightweight
10842, FUNNY, ### and here when you see the robot interacting with me on a desktop and i'm actually redesigning the robot so unbeknownst to itself it's kind of digging its own grave by helping me
11243, NOTFUNNY, ### our emphasis on solutions is quite intentional
14538, FUNNY, ### i walk during the day and i follow people who i think look interesting
2109, NOTFUNNY, ### many years later my mom developed frozen shoulder which leads to pain and stiffness in the shoulder
741, NOTFUNNY, ### indus

8868, NOTFUNNY, ### you don't drink
5934, FUNNY, ### i just wish i could afford the tuition
14488, FUNNY, ### but when i'm sitting in my car after an hour and a half of commute every day that reality looks very different
5120, NOTFUNNY, ### and in fact that's actually sustaining a long standing trend that predates human beings ok that biological evolution was doing for us
13207, NOTFUNNY, ### he died long after he left the pillow at my house but we never got around to returning it

3161, FUNNY, ### they told me that they preferred me on than in person
6657, FUNNY, ### you know
12801, FUNNY, ### what i see is this one
5238, NOTFUNNY, ### if i had to hear it hours non stop it might be very tiring
6631, FUNNY, ### although he did make a note to himself that the next time he proposed it was perhaps not necessary to enumerate all of the women he had auditioned for the part
4578, FUNNY, ### two half years in the making
9555, FUNNY, ### and to be honest with you we could have finished earlier but i think it took us three weeks because of all those tea breaks
14784, FUNNY, ### and he emailed me this picture
173, NOTFUNNY, ### this is my sketch from february and when you give this sketch to professional people in the norwegian broadcasting company you get some cool stuff back
5533, FUNNY, ### even in the first seven days there was one parody for every other day of the week

2354, FUNNY, ### the paper apologized but said it never runs photos of women they might be sexually provocative

14607, NOTFUNNY, ### let's take a look at san francisco
3051, FUNNY, ### and i thought a hotdog will be more symbolic
12735, FUNNY, ### we would not do this today unless we were doing it for film
4864, FUNNY, ### ever
6018, FUNNY, ### and some even accused me of feigning the whole thing to push and i quote my feminist agenda of man hating
10256, FUNNY, ### i'm not ready
8972, NOTFUNNY, ### she never made eye contact with me
2964, NOTFUNNY, ### i took the painting and gifted new contemporary meaning talking about issues which are surrounding me in russia capturing people who are non models but have an interesting story
650, NOTFUNNY, ### so we simulated that as well and then the really tricky bit is to teach that network how to walk
14152, NOTFUNNY, ### he said he recorded many long hours in various to be used in the voice
2165, NOTFUNNY, ### you have to access coalition partners
4761, NOTFUNNY, ### and this project began essentially on my kitchen table
5362, FUNNY, ### in in president estrada a million people each other about the corruption of that regime eventually brought it down and it was of course called the coup de text
1532, FUNNY, ### so here is a typical stud wall an architectural construction and this is a section of our proposal for a meat house where you can see we use fatty cells as insulation for dealing with wind loads and muscles for the doors and windows
9006, FUNNY, ### maybe a pure form a single form of emanation that you could imagine would be all dome and everything we kept making was looking too much like an egg
5665, NOTFUNNY, ### of course the milk can is his
11266, FUNNY, ### what we have here is a painting of the great poet burns and it's just a normal image but if we now switch inputs over to the phone running our technology you can see effectively what seeing on the screen and when she points at this image something magical happens
6178, FUNNY, ### also in the bible one sees that the death penalty was the accepted punishment for crimes such as homosexuality adultery blasphemy idolatry talking back to your parents and picking up sticks on the sabbath
6730, NOTFUNNY, ### he is down
10266, FUNNY, ### and in the words of malcolm gladwell crack cocaine was the extra chunky version of tomato sauce for the inner city
11561, FUNNY, ### but it's the it's cool
14715, NOTFUNNY, ### a million brains ok now we're talking
12050, NOTFUNNY, ### so the first group is i am most drawn to my partner when she is away when we are apart when we reunite
3244, FUNNY, ### so naturally the only way out of the slump that i could think of was i decided to call oprah
2900, NOTFUNNY, ### i'm going to hold this panel in front of me but i'm not going to move it
7329, FUNNY, ### this was a group of eminent economists apologizing to the queen of england when she asked the question why did no one tell us that the crisis was coming i'll never get my knighthood
14350, NOTFUNNY, ### you know this little office of the conductor
5301, FUNNY, ### now the people in the front row are very nervous
4944, NOTFUNNY, ### so the way this works is whenever you're a just a beginner we give you very simple sentences
9957, NOTFUNNY, ### it took us years to reach annual savings ratings of almost percent
717, FUNNY, ### the picture i'm about to show you is a compelling picture
14629, FUNNY, ### by now you're probably thinking of all the advantages of country living
13426, NOTFUNNY, ### too much
1779, NOTFUNNY, ### i hope that we can all be a little bit brave when we most need such bravery
6520, FUNNY, ### so i was excited then i panicked then i was excited then i panicked and in between the excitement and the panicking i started to do my research and my research primarily consisted of how to give a great ted talk
8797, FUNNY, ### i take some solace from winston churchill who put it this way the americans can be counted on to do the right thing once they have exhausted the alternatives
11256, NOTFUNNY, ### so as we talked richard and i i said you know maybe i should bring a camel
10786, NOTFUNNY, ### and the limiting factor there and here is not resources because they're plentiful but knowledge which is scarce
15423, FUNNY, ### you see the geniality of his creation right directly on the ground layer of the panel and see this cool thing finding i should rather say an elephant
9007, FUNNY, ### you can imagine also that movement within a circle could mean movement and stillness like the cosmos something you see in many places
9921, NOTFUNNY, ### surgery the follow up showed luckily little to no growth of the cancer
616, FUNNY, ### see how he developed a vocal game together with my wife only from the desire and pure joy of being coupled to another human being
3639, NOTFUNNY, ### the thing to appreciate about vehicle safety is this is
12399, NOTFUNNY, ### there is this special day which they call very special day where a man who is hired by the community comes to the camp and sleeps with the little girls
8265, FUNNY, ### a paint company donated a thousand liters of yellow paint mixed especially for us in what they now call optimistic yellow
6895, FUNNY, ### which is ironic because i'm a capitalist
14504, NOTFUNNY, ### this is how the year would go
3994, FUNNY, ### because finally there was a page that actually felt like what it felt like to hit a
3944, FUNNY, ### the only thing i had to do was go out pick them up and have them stuffed for the collection
14938, NOTFUNNY, ### this is a we're doing some flight testing on my little seeing if this can really grab
12363, FUNNY, ### we don't have to have a craft fair here to get people to come here

963, FUNNY, ### so we did a second parabola
3425, FUNNY, ### they talked about what they'd done to buy those different properties and earn their success in the game
10737, FUNNY, ### okay we can do that
8089, NOTFUNNY, ### it's not a specific thing
15379, FUNNY, ### and then he goes away for a few seconds to think about it some more and thinks maybe if i come in from a different angle
10594, NOTFUNNY, ### and here's what i learned from laboring women
265, FUNNY, ### but we've even had that here on stage so don't act like you don't know what i'm talking about
401, NOTFUNNY, ### and what i'm trying to do with my work is put faces to this
3631, NOTFUNNY, ### and looking at tunneling technology it turns out that in order to make a tunnel you have to in order to seal against the water table you've got to typically design a tunnel wall to be good to about five or six
8887, FUNNY, ### so the farmers go out at night with heavily armed jeeps and shine the headlights and anything that doesn't look like a sheep you shoot
8549, NOTFUNNY, ### adaptability meritocracy and legitimacy are the three defining characteristics of china's one party system

7952, FUNNY, ### one of them was i used to lie on the kitchen floor of my childhood home and i would suck the thumb of my left hand and hold my mom's cold toes with my right hand
14519, FUNNY, ### and they can use that energy in case the wind falls away and the tide is coming up and there is still a little bit of energy to reach the dunes and save their lives because they are drowned very easily

4088, FUNNY, ### your phone is not the internet's door bitch
5843, NOTFUNNY, ### and i could see my father yeah he really is crazy
12742, FUNNY, ### with a list of symptoms this long and wide i could have you could have the guy in the third row here could have my dog could have
7470, FUNNY, ### but if you were to guess
1012, FUNNY, ### this mouthing behavior on the right was really her way of saying to him hey look how big i am or you know my what big teeth you have
1531, NOTFUNNY, ### there was a program on tv about jobs most kids don't know about
5183, NOTFUNNY, ### people thought it was kind of a crazy point of view

7692, NOTFUNNY, ### so instead of trying to make a car that can fly we decided to try to make a plane that could drive
1055, FUNNY, ### today one in men in the is at least seven feet tall but a seven man is incredibly rare in the general population so rare that if you know an american man between the ages of and who is at least seven feet tall there's a percent chance he's in the right now
445, NOTFUNNY, ### i'm suffering from gallery fatigue
4079, NOTFUNNY, ### and these are examples of some of the kids' work

11054, FUNNY, ### it looks like a big boring word but it's actually quite exciting because is the only with in it
3880, NOTFUNNY, ### and so we built a laboratory in the back of an trailer and actually took the laboratory to the field where we could get better samples
4134, FUNNY, ### you can pay bills with it you can buy your groceries you can pay your kids' school fees and i'm told you can even bribe customs officials
10388, NOTFUNNY, ### and we started a studio
14447, FUNNY, ### have you yourself experienced any of the syndromes you write about i was afraid you'd ask that
1044, NOTFUNNY, ### this is a train which goes from london to paris
