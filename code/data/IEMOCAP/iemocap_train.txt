Ses02M_script02_1_F022, fru, 314.6700, 316.8300 ### It's ridiculous.
Ses04M_impro04_M008, fru, 82.2472, 90.8700 ### But, like, it's been years now and I just can't seem to get anything that really fits.  It's just it -- I -- it drives me absolutely insane.

Ses04M_script02_1_M019, fru, 155.7300, 167.0880 ### Yeah, but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives.  I mean, all that flopping around is laying eggs or what do you -- spawning or mating, something like that.
Ses05M_script02_1_M017, exc, 154.6200, 164.0679 ### Honey, it's a natural phenomenon.  I mean, this kind of thing only happens once a year.  It's a great opportunity.
