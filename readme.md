This repository contains the official implementation of our paper: AMST: Alternating Multimodal Skip Training.

The code has been refactored from the initial version, with efforts made to keep it as clean and readable as possible.
We strive to maintain consistency with the version used in our paper.

If you encounter any issues or have suggestions, your feedback is highly appreciated.
We will do our best to maintain and improve this repositoryâ€”although, as you might understand, it can sometimes be challenging.
